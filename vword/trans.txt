okay this is according to when i was working at atandt that um we had to come up with an application that was used for uh small group interactions like you would call someone and another person and the third person uh the application had a small like uh sort of guide to look up peoples name etcetera uh the problems was that uh it was very forward looking so it was like a group of people loosely brought together and there really wasn't a leader in that uh condition and on my job was at the time i was doing human factors which is ease of use and i was also doing some web design too so there was some design elements there as well and uh what i decided at the early out set because i didn't want this to the one of those projects that happened at atandt a lot which is to just to spiral into nowhere was i started to create prototypes very early on that were interactive rather than just give screenings and diagrams of what to do i created an interactive prototype that people could use and started to distribute that teams of developers to the and artist etcetera uh even there was a marketing person on the team uh and so i did that because like i said i wanted to see i thought it was a great project and i wanted to see it go at least close to close and uh so by doing that a lot of people would bounce all the ideas off of me the developers would come to me with their designs afterwards to make sure they match with uh what i was designing and for the most part i helped bring that i believe i helped bring that uh entire project to close and they did actually create a product and try it out it was again this experimental product but they did do that so um it was i don't normally like to be a leader but again i just didn't feel like i was going to waste my time on a project which happened at atandt a lot so uh like i said had a good benefit at the end
when i was working here uh in my fourth or fifth year we were bringing toefl new toefl out to the market and uh it had already launched but there was a huge amount of development we still had to do on it because we need to get it out at a certain point so this was sort of like a phase two part of the project uh and i was one of the business analysts there were five lead business analysts and each business analyst had four or five people assigned to them uh systems analysts if you will and uh at that time they also decide set up a multi program type of registration system so all the other analysts were put on there and i was a given all of toefl uh and all of the systems analysts that was close to eighteen people uh reporting back to me and there was also a lot of uh frustration amongst uh these systems analysts because they were right at the forefront uh to get everything done in time so i would say morale wasn't exactly high uh so one of the things the first thing of it of course was i had my own job to do i still had to do the business analyst part and i had to do it for all the missing business analysts so the first thing i did of course was to delegate and i created a structure so who reported to whom etcetera that helps with the whole work aspect the amount of emails i got etcetera and timing we spent was cut down drastically so that was sort of phase one of my solution the second thing was of course to deal with the uh morale and that was a little trickier because there were people who were not getting along with each other people who were etcetera but i also had to go by their skills set so uh i managed to put together four teams that were working very well probably only needed about maybe an hour's worth of my time every week but then there were two other teams that i dealt with some conflicts so all i had to do what i had to do is sacrifice a little bit of my own time and make sure i was in those team meetings and those group meetings a lot and then provide reinforcement and also be a buffer whenever it was needed and we got everything out in time so it was a good success
uh in the example i was just giving um in two of the teams i said there was some personality problems i do recall specifically two people in one team that could not get along at all because they both came at every problem from opposite sides and just continued to argue back and forth but they were both very good at what they were doing uh and needed to be within that function that they were working on because that's where their expertise was so um in that case at first it was difficult because i was getting inundated with private emails from both of them so i had to take as i said before a more active involvement in meetings with them and i had to deal with certain occasions was just um to pull one aside at some point and say look i've read what you have it's valid but we're going with the other i would just say that's the way we're doing it that makes decisions as if they were momentously important they weren't but they were just sticking points that they were getting stuck on so i just 'called the shots' type of situation instead of trying to i did not at all  work to try to mediate so i just said and that worked because they i guess would respected my opinion so when i called for one or the other they went along with it and things calmed down pretty quickly
one of the things i'm most proud about uh starting here at ets and then all the time i've been here is the ability to have the trust of the uh business stake holders sbu's we call them uh in toefl it's a very high pressured uh program because we do provide a lot of the money that ets makes there's competition in the field etcetera so the business unit itself is very often under pressure and when i came on board as the eba for them they were extremely dissatisfied at that time with uh the interactions with it with their interactions with i knew the process going there and um what i did was i approached it very simply as i have as sort of a usability expert is the first thing you need to do is find out what's wrong have people run through things and listen and look and watch and get all the information you could about where the major problems are where in the user interface so it's the same thing with uh interacting with people and i went to them i introduced myself i asked them literally what problems are you having? and i assured them that i would fix them and i did i mean that's the easiest thing is to say uh what do you do in those situations? well you do what needs to be done to gain their trust and if it's fast response times you do that uh always i always made sure that every response back was completely truthful i never tried to hide anything because i think in the past they were being misled was something they didn't like as well so if we were going to have a delay they knew about it and they knew why and before long i was hearing things like um why isn't that happening? and i was taught to explain well that's good enough we trust you so to this day they really do like working with me and i do like working with that team very much and i think that's part of the reason i feel like it's a major accomplishment it makes me feel good about the work i do here and um i think they're very satisfied with my performance
being a business analyst you're forever trying to compromise you have business needs and then you have development requirements needs as well so the business wants certain work to be done but then it has to fit into a development schedule and uh sometimes what's seen as one side is very easy either well you can change the requirement or the other side as well or we can just do x uh turns out to be very complicated uh the best thing to do in those situations when i have to work and try to come out with something that both sides are happy with of course is just take the problem break it down first so if the business comes and they say we have a need i often might be hearing a solution to that need so i have to figure out what is the actual root problem what are they trying to solve? so i can at least boil it down to that that gives me more options when i work with development because they can suggest different solutions and i can go back to again the business uh in some cases it's a matter of just talking for instance that this is why something is difficult or to the development why this is more important because everything is important from sometimes if the business sends things over you have to explain why a specific item is more important and you really will find that you get by and very quickly from people when they understand what's at stake uh or if they understand what the difficulties that have to be surmounted another thing we do is we make sure everything gets prioritized uh that really helps a lot when you have to come out with uh a mutual solution because someone could readily see how important or unimportant certain factors are to the other side and then they can come in some meeting it happens a lot and it's one of the things we have to do in our job uh more often than not
getting people to buy into a proposal i have um it's difficult to narrow that down to one specific instance because it happens often i could say before i was in uh usability design where you have to propose solutions to sometimes external clients sometimes internal i would say uh web design the same thing you come back with your proposal and business analyst sometimes you have to um bring as i said before business needs to a group and propose uh priorities uh schedule etcetera but in all those times uh what always helps is uh i would present data i present information in a clean logical orderly fashion that usually is the best convincer uh especially when it came to design work uh you explain why the design was the way it was why the graphics were laid out the way they were and how you decided along the lines of the steps people would take to get from a to b in a particular website or application uh by doing that you're selling your idea and if it's logical and consistent and makes good sense and in some cases is efficient in terms of costs etcetera you have a winning solution so um  it's happened it's part and parcel of all the jobs i've ever done so again i can't really zero in on just one
uh there have been many times when i've had to work with people that i didn't quite get along with uh sometimes it was because of the personality of the individual and sometimes i realize it was just because of a mix of personalities between myself and the individual like i would and those are the easy ones that i would realize it's okay just because i don't get along with that person? because they have certain character traits that's the opposite of mine i could just dismiss them more readily but there are people i've worked with which have been exceptionally difficult to deal with and uh as i've learned over the years is the best thing to do is sigh privately uh and just keep your eyes on the goal of what you're trying to do on the project if they're difficult to deal with if they're always uh glued for instance we can let them be with you doesn't make a difference as long as you get a good job done no one is really going to care in the end and uh very often all the projects we work on are a short term i think if it was something where for instance someone had to work with consistently the manager or something like that i would have to you have ways to escalate etcetera but for the most part uh you just get through it and you stay professional i mean that's the best way to do it is keep everything and allow it to a professional level and uh let all the irritation out when you get home uh ride the bike or something like that that's all i could say uh
i got some unpleasant tasks uh no likes when you have a lot of the tedious boring ones but you can get to those i think the ones that people have to watch out for are the ones that are physically demanding uh i know that one of my when i was very young one of my bosses put me in a uh really terrible situation where uh he had me working full time going to an after hours program at city university of new york which was a good hour and ten minute drive and uh then put me on a secondary project that was additional work to my own so i was literally getting about three or four hours of sleep at night every night for an entire year and uh i did complain i did explain to him that i think my work was suffering and what eventually happened is actually ended up with a heart arrhythmia from the stress uh and so i had to just literally sit down and tell him that on doctor's notice that if he didn't change one of my priorities immediately i would get ill and he'd be responsible so uh that's the only time i think people really need to pay attention to uh what the job is demanding if stress levels are inordinately high otherwise if they're things like as mentioned uh tedious or boring you'd find ways to distract yourself if you could do it that's not so bad but physically demanding or extremely stressful especially physically demanding that's what you have to watch out for uh and be vocal about it that what i did learn i should have spoken up much earlier but i have learned that since if things are too physically stressful i make that very clear to whomever my immediate manager is
uh there have been times when i've had been on projects where one or two people have directed the set the direction of the project and there are people who could have contributed more but may have been a little bit more withdrawn and uh the best thing to do in those situations is to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to contribute and if you feel like the project is not going that way uh you could always call me in specific topic and make sure that the people who could contribute better have an opportunity to do something so you've got to go to them personally first and say look i want to set up this meeting for whatever topic which they've been trying to get sort of a push in and then uh get that more visible make sure everyone has the visibility to it uh i think as people again maybe ignore their contribution the idea is it's been made it's been documented and uh so somebody decides to make a different decisions based on what they feel instead of what they've seen that's always just going to be on themso
okay now earlier i had talked about when i first came on as a business analyst in toefl um lead business analysts uh part of the problem they had was communication with the it groups and so one of the things i did as i said is i went i sat down with all the members team individually and to get to more a detailed level uh what i really did in the listening part of it was i actually listened for i think i call them catch phrases or phrases that were repeated over and over from person to person that was my first clue where there was a problem so if somebody said uh mentioned the phrase uh um weight on cost estimates came up a number of times i'd want to backtrack and find out why those costs estimates were late and what was it was it just personally somebody just sat on them or was it because we didn't have a good process whatever it was but the idea was i use what i call catch phrases so something you hear a phrase or a statement that's very similar from person to person that helps you map to a common problem in communication because uh although everybody is different i think what irritates each person in specific circumstance if there's a general agreement you know that the problems on the far end not on the people who you're trying to deal with it's on our end for instance it so because they all have like if they all have that common complaint and uh by doing that as i've mentioned before really solved  a lot of the problems and a lot of them had to do with uh um lateness of response to  requests and part of that of course is knowing what are the important requests and what aren't important so that's what i had done and that's what i sort of continue to do just keep the ear open for those things
i don't know if it's culture of growing up in new york or not but i have never had difficulty in expressing my opinion uh and that includes sometimes having to give critical or difficult information critical feedback or difficult information and it doesn't whether it's to a supervisor or an individual of course i'm not blunt about it i try to couch things in terms of you know it might be a good idea to do or i think there's a problem with to start off but to actually get to what the problem is uh i just say it because if you do not like the way i've been brought up if you don't say what the problem is you're never going to fix it and uh i've had to do that with uh supervision that's been difficult and supervision's been accommodating and all different types of people and i actually i think i have a reputation for just speaking my mind so uh that's it
um there have been a number of times where i had had to take something that i've gotten say from the it side uh as an explanation of why we could uh do something but it was going to be very complex although it seems simple or why we couldn't accomplish something without a lot more time money etcetera and present that to the business and um in all fairness it isn't that the business wouldn't understand some of the complexity but my goal was not to get into technical detail but to get more into the reasons on what we should do so very often what i do is i take a look at the whole thing i get all the information i can first which is all the technical information all the complexities i work it out and say if i have to create a powerpoint slides etcetera i work out what is at the high level for each of the box of things i need to go over what at the high level is the message that's being given so it's not as important to know what the specific field lens are going from legacy to the new system etcetera and why system a can directly communicate with system b etcetera that isn't the important thing is to simply say a cannot communicate with b and i mean that's just the central message or that um uh if information is going to go from one system to another we've got to completely change what the layouts and formats are because the informations are different again it's always what the reasons or what the effects are and what the reasons are but not trying to get mired into details because that's what happens sometimes people go down to such a detailed level and you lose your audience um uh because people are to busy trying to find out and understand those details when that may not be the important thing of course if the technical detail is important it's critical you can go and spend time in that one detail but assuming here that were talking about trying to get to the understanding of a system or complexity so that's how i've done it by the way um um the one about the communicating to be honest the real answer should have been you mustn't say fix the communications whose ever on the phone and typing could you mute your side that's the most common uh   i've been guilty of that myself  i know i've forgotten sometimes it's not on mute isn't this the same thing?  um let's see  because question one is  okay if it went back to the beginning of the prompts then yes
um i don't have a specific response to this question but um i do believe that i am constantly striving to be um in a leadership role when i'm doing my work um i uh have never been the formal leader uh in any of my positions i've always been in a support role but um the tasks that i am provided with i do i'm a self starter and i do try to take on as much responsibility as i can in order to accomplish them um with precision and perfection um i'm trying to think of something specific to give you but uh i it's really just kind of a constant thing with me that i'm in whatever task i'm given i try to take on the role of responsibility and get it done appropriately
um i guess this would be it's it actually isn't really work related but it's i we in the role that i have we are sort of the um social planners for the division and um it sometimes falls to me to arrange the social gatherings for the group that's in terms of when we're celebrating birthdays or that kind of thing and um it does take a bit of a rallying to get the group that i work with to concentrate on something um that's a little bit less um test oriented uh shall we say so um i do tend to have to kind of rally through to get um these things planned and get them off the ground and um we did just have our uh summer picnic and um we managed to get the group out and get um everything planned um from the sign up sheet and the donations and everything to actually getting a location to have this and um enjoying it when we finally planned it so um i don't uh i'm sort of in the job that i currently have i'm in a sort of it's a solitary role but every once in a while there is an opportunity to get the group together and to umcooperate so um and it went well
i uh try to be the peace keeper uh when i am well basically all the time when i'm at work or otherwise uh so uh the again the situation was when we were attempting to plan something for the group um and uh we had several different ideas about how the the uh event should go uh and some people wanted to make it very extravagant and others wanted it to be very simple uh so i basically just tried to get a compromise uh to come about uh it was not all that successful but uh we did actually manage to get the uh event taken care of but uh the really i think the only way to deal with that kind of uh disagreement when you're working together is to try to get some type of movement on either side as far as uh a compromise is concerned because it's really not possible to let either party have his or her own way so uh that's usually my go to response is to try to come up with a compromise and uh between two disagreeing parties
i believe this is uh sort of a constant thing when ah one is working um i recently had uh a change in supervisors and um i think that is really uh a time a recent time when i felt that i was trying to get to know a person that i was working with it was actually for my boss and also um try to um maintain the uh way that my role had been setup within the group um sometimes when new management comes on board they uh that individual has different ideas about what they want their team to be doing and i was hired for a specific role and so um i was spending uh quite a bit of energy trying to make sure that my new manager and i got off on the right foot that i was also um working to make sure that i remained happy um in the position that i had been hired for so um i at this point i think we have of course we are working together well and i think it's been a successful transition um in most things i believe i was successful in my negotiation but there have been a few items added to my role that were not initially supposed to have been there but um again we came to a compromise and uh i think it seems to have been a successful um relationship continues to be a successful relationship
this answer sort of piggy backs off of the one that i just gave uh again going back to my new management situation uh again the role that i was hired the job that i was hired to do did not necessarily fit the title that i was given and so uh when my supervisor who came from a different department arrived there was some minor disagreement about how to proceed uh with my role within the group so uh i feeling very strongly about what i had been hired to do uh i had to negotiate and bargain and ultimately compromise uh but i did quite well i mean i've taken on some additional uh tasks that were not initially part of the role i was hired for uh they do they  obviously add to my skill set and uh we have you know we like to continue learning and professional development is a good thing uh and they are not they don't detract from what i what i enjoy doing and what i was hired to do so it worked out rather well
in my current role it seems that um whenever i propose an idea uh we have a discussion about it and then i hear about it for a while and then suddenly the idea is in place and we are following the new rule that i suggested uh three weeks prior and no credit is given to me um so i basically put everything in an email so that um when i do come up with these ideas about uh process improvements or what have you uh i have them documented so that when the powers that be um eventually decide that yes it is a valid point and it is a good idea um i have the proof that it was something that i suggested and i can then put it in my um results for the year um but yes it's an unfortunate situation and the in on the project that i work on um this happens a couple of times and uh it's fine i know that i have uh documented that i'm the one that came up with the idea so um i just hold on to them until it's appropriate to add them to my uh performance appraisal for the year i guess i should mention the the specific uh examples so um we had for one thing um copyright permissions that our partners were managing but we have a database at ets where their information was only partially included and i wanted the permissions uploaded and eventually they were
thankfully this doesn't happen all that often um i don't know whether that's because i'm easy to get along with or um i just really have nice people in my group um but there is one individual that uh does give me a little bit of difficulty uh when i'm working with her uh it's really and it's not even that traumatic it's basically just a uh she has this tendency of uh telling me how to do my portion of the job uh when it would be really great if she concentrated on getting her portion of the job done um and uh i think i mean it's just it's a personality thing i think it's just she just you know it's the mom in her or something uh but it really drives me crazy uh so uh i have different reactions to this i usually just try to ignore her comments uh but sometimes it becomes necessary for me to comment and i'm constantly it's a constant effort to just try to remain calm and collected um and i really just i just smile and nod and sometimes i will take her suggestions just to kind of move the day along uh and sometimes i kind of just pretend that i'm taking her suggestions but really it's we're outwardly friends it's not a huge deal we don't it doesn't preclude us from being able to work together
this must be why i want to come and work at your company because i never have found that unpleasant tasks get shared among employees um usually in the roles that i've had i am constantly fighting uh not to have all of the unpleasant tasks dumped into my realm and this is part of going back to the situation with my change in supervision and the role that i was hired to do it's a constant fight to not be sort of pushed back into that you know copy these ten thousand pages and put these five hundred binders together um it's not the role that i was hired for and um so i although i am constantly trying to help out the group and volunteer and do more than my fair share um i also understand that if i want to progress and to get where i want to go i need to be able to take on more interesting and more complicated um more demanding tasks so being stuck in a copy room uh eight hours a day is not going to get me where i need to go so um i am it's a constant bargaining and compromise and negotiation uh to make sure that um i don't get burdened with all of the um stuff that um doesn't take any brain power to complete
the first event that comes to mind uh in response to this question is actually not at work but at school um i had a professor actually the first professor that i uh had class with upon returning to school to finish my bachelors and this particular individual was very uh opinionated and rather than enjoying and um encouraging the expression of her students it was very much that it was obvious that it was a sort of my way or the highway type of arrangement and uh made uh grading essays and papers uh for this individual rather interesting um i actually when i was taking the class i actually thought that i was not going to fair very well because i'm a rather stubborn individual and um in this particular situation i really wasn't interested in just feeding her back what she had uh feed me so um i did go ahead and write papers that i wanted to write and actually surprisingly it worked out um she had some rather unkind things to say when i submitted my thesis statement and my uh first couple of pages of draft for my final paper but when i gave her the finished product uh it obviously worked out because i did very well in the class
i'm using my listening skills constantly uh in my uh role um i don't really have a specific situation for this because i really think that listening is a hugely important part of the entire communication process um i can think of one colleague that um is one of those individuals that um tries to talk constantly during any kind of discussion of procedure or project or what have you and um  not only that they talk very loudly and um so basically i just let this individual do most of the talking in that situation um i find that sometimes when um people are very vocal i will not say too much when we are in person but then i may recap an email afterwards just to make sure that we are all on the same page and that way it sort of levels the communication playing fields if you will and we can recount what was actually discussed in this meeting by an email where nobody is trying to talk over anyone else
well thankfully i haven't had to say anything to my supervisor about anything that i've done incorrectly um i uh generally what i'll do is i will i send an email and usually what i'm doing is i'm forwarding an email because i will have been in communication with uh someone else on the project that i'm working on and um i will need to let my supervisor know either what's being asked of me or if something has gone awry in the piece of the project that we're working on um i need to let my supervisor know because it's going to take more of my time uh so generally email first and then take a walk over to uh her office so that she can absorb the email and then when i show up she's going to know what's going on and we can talk about what if anything uh i need to do or needs to happen that i hadn't already thought of um i guess i mean the only feedback that i guess i might have been uncomfortable with was when my professor had asked me to evaluate my supervisor had asked me to evaluate some of my colleagues as part of their performance appraisal and um i did you know i needed there were some things that i needed to say based on the work that i had been doing with these individuals and so um you know i mean i was honest i presented the information as um neutrally as possible and um we carry on
there aren't i don't deal with too too much complex or too too many complex or technical ideas uh in my current role but um i can think of a couple of uh instances where i had to train some colleagues uh to cover some of my tasks on a project as i was going out for vacation and um i think i'm pretty good at this i am a um i learn by doing so i generally try to take that attack with people that i am trying to teach how to do something and i will have them walk through the process or the procedure that i am trying to teach them so that they have the actual it's like that hand-eye coordination thing where if they're actually doing it i feel that it sort of registers with them a little bit more than if we're just talking about the concept rather than following through with actually doing it um i try to be i have uh quite a bit of patience so um i try to give individuals time to learn new things we'll talk about it once and then have another session a couple of days later to see if there are any further questions and to see to make sure that they remember what we talked about and that they're comfortable with what um they need to be doing
okay so i'll talk about a situation when i was a teacher so i was working uh with a group of teachers who were all doing the same writing in class and we normally had uh one leader who would be there to help us out and make a lot of the plans but that teacher uh was out sick so we were doing our planning uh without him um so since it was a fairly large group it uh became clear that we needed somebody to act like a leader so uh we had a list of things that we needed to do so some materials we had to prepare uh some schedules we needed to make and some things that we were going to have to turn in uh at a certain point and i just uh tried to come up with a schedule for things that we could uh do a way to divide up some of the tasks so uh i knew people had done some of the things before so i got them to uh repeat that to do what they had already done the last time that we talked together um and yeah basically i just i feel like started the scheduling and uh didn't have to do too much to to be in that kind of leadership role but it kind of got everything going because we were a little bit taken aback that the person who was supposed to be doing that wasn't there and then in the end we got everything done that we needed to do so uh it worked out fine
so uh i'll talk about a time when my coworkers and i were working on rating some essays at the end of a semester so in the program where we worked all the teachers got together at the end of the semester to evaluate the essays that students wrote and it's a pretty big uh undertaking to get all of the essays for all of the students uh in that program all rated on the same day um double rated so two teachers um giving a score for each essay uh the background was uh a little bit more about the background for this particular time is that there was some other event on campus and a lot of the instructors who would normally be there ended up not coming or leaving early so we had a lot more work to do than we normally would have um so people were getting pretty frustrated with it and thinking that we were going to going to be there like all evening to finish up this work so um what i tried to do to motivate people uh was to get an estimate of how much we needed to do how much we um already done try to figure out how much time it was taking us to do it and then when we had a clear idea of the amount of work that needed to be don i think people calmed down and uh were less upset about how much stuff we were going to have to do and then uh motivated to work quickly because when you had a real estimate of when you were going to be done uh it helped it really helped to pace yourself so it didn't take all night
uh i'll talk about a time when i was working in a group of instructors uh we were teaching the same classes for the same two months period and we would regularly have to get together for some meetings uh to work on uh  like reports for our director and some planning for our classes uh since we were teaching the same classes and it had to do with getting students matriculated to the university we needed to stay calibrated and uh grade our assignments to stay and do the same amount of work so we had to meet together a lot um and there were two teachers who just had batted heads pretty regularly because they had different ideas about how to do things the best way um so uh i knew that both of them really wanted the same thing they wanted to do well at what we had to do so i tried to uh when i was in charge of making a decision all of that would have something to do with the two of them i would try to like play to their strength so one that was really good at organizing and schedules i tried to get her to take the lead on that so that she would feel uh comfortable doing that job and then the uh other woman was particularly creative so when we had something that had some flexibility and uh room for creativity i would uh try to encourage her too to take over that so that each of them could do something that they were good at and not be together trying to decide uh the same thing because they would argue about it if they were both involved in the decision making if it was just those two uh it seemed okay in the end
um i was working at a program where we got a new assistant director and she kind of came into a little bit of a hostile environment because people had expected an internal candidate to be hired for the position that she got and she came from outside of our program to be in charge um and it was also at a time in the program where uh we had some pretty big changes to our students were a little bit uh different of a population than our program was used to dealing with our program grew quite a bit so we had more students than we uh were used to having so we were having to come up with some new ways to deal with things like especially uh registration getting all the students signed up to classes giving schedules to everybody making sure that all of the international students knew how to get to the different classroom buildings and stuff like that so there was a lot of negotiation because everybody had their own idea of what worked before what didn't work and how we should change it and then there was the fact that she was new um a lot of the other uh teachers and some of the administrators had some kind of not great feeling about her they weren't sure about her so i felt like i needed to get her to trust me and i was also one of the newer uh teachers um so i tried to talk to her about how we were both new and maybe didn't know the area as well how we had this thing in common uh so like having some small talk in between our meetings or uh during meal times or something just to try to see what we had in common so that maybe she'd start to trust me and then i could get my opinion through
um i was working at a program teaching and there was an instructor who had been at that program for a very long time so i think more than twenty years he had been in charge for a really long time and all of a sudden there were a bunch of new teachers doing the same thing uh the same class that he was where he normally would have been teaching that class just on his own he would have been the only instructor there'd been one section one of the class um so since there was all of a sudden some more uh sections there were new instructors um but since he had been doing it for so long had a really rigid uh set of uh assignments uh with a set of schedules and uh rubrics a really specific way that he wanted everything done but it didn't really work with all the instructors teaching styles and we didn't think that it was the only way to have uh to get across what needed to be taught and to get the learning goals accomplished so uh we decided to talk with him about uh what in his plan absolutely had to be done and uh where there were places uh for us to do some things that were interested in or to change things up and try something new um so uh we met at the part of the normal planning process with him uh we outlined some things that we agreed we thought should be done and we brought up some things that we would like to try um and he didn't want to try them but he agreed with us that it was worth a shot and then he asked how it went um i still didn't think he would change his mind but it didn't seem like he thought we did a bad job
uh once when i was teaching we had uh the time in their curriculum when they were deciding whether or not to continue using uh the textbook or to get a new one um and they sent a few of us to a conference where there was a textbook fair we had the opportunity to look at a bunch of different ones and then um they asked us to make recommendations so um what i did ahead of time was to make a list of problems that had come up with the textbook that was being used so some issues that teachers had had or that students had had using that textbook um and then with the new one that we found at the um book fair um i made a list of uh what i thought in that new book um would be better um than the old one and how it would address some of the issues um that had come up with the old bookum in the end they continued using the old one anyway i think they had a deal with the publisher that they would be exclusive and only use that line of textbooks so um they didn't switch over to the new one but because we had a few copies of the new book and we had pointed out some good things that the new book had that the old book didn't have i think a lot of um material out of that book ended up getting used so it ended up being useful even though the proposal to totally change textbooks didn't get accepted
i had a supervisor uh that i didn't especially get along with uh for a while so he was in charge of a group of teachers who were all teaching the same course and he seemed to have a particular uh bias against newer teachers that since he was so experienced um he seemed to have a hard time accepting uh a lot of the newer teachers i think he was unhappy with how fast the program had grown and how quickly they had to hire new teachers and he seemed to think that some of us because we were newer uh weren't experienced enough to be doing the same job as him since he had so many more years of experience um so behaviors that i carried out in response to the situation um i tried to uh limit any kind of discussion of uh personal issues things about being young or being new or having less experience like not uh trying to exasperate you know that problem i also you know like i realized he did have a lot of the experience and a lot of good advice so i would ask him you know what would you do? i have this situation or i have this challenge and do you have some advice for me? and he ended up being happy to share advice and i mean of course he thought he knew a lot better than i knew uh what to do so he was happy to tell me what to do um the outcome was you know we were able to work together you know we didn't become best friends or anything but we did what we had to do and it was not super unpleasant
one of the places where i worked would divide up some unpleasant tasks pretty evenly uh to begin with so things like um we served coffee to our students once a week in the uh library and it was our responsibilities since we were guests to the library to clean up so like vacuum uh wash down the tables um after that so it would initially be split up evenly among everybody but there would always be people who had been there a long time who didn't show up or all of a sudden they were unavailable when it was their turn and as one of the newer employees i was asked to do it to like step in more often than other people um and i tried to look at it as an opportunity to work with some people that i didn't normally work with so a lot of times one of the assistance directors would also be doing that so since you know we were kind of vacuuming together taking out the trash together it was a little bit of a bonding experience so i tried to turn it into something positive of getting to know her better um and i think that that worked for me another unpleasant task was substituting for teachers they didn't pay people to substitute they would just call you up and say oh my gosh so and so is sick can you please come step in and do his class because i lived really close by i got called a lot more than anybody else so it you know i think it was more than my fair share of that um i understood why they were doing it i initially always was accepting it because i wanted to make a good impression but um after i had been there a little bit longer i would say because sometimes i had something else to do i couldn't just drop everything and run to uh substitute teach a class i would just say you know i'm sorry i'm not available or even maybe not pick up the phone um but i didn't get fired so
i was in a uh group of people planning a reading and writing classum we had a woman who was in charge of the groups since she had been there the longest and we were trying to decide which novel to read uh for our class um and she basically ignored everybody else's suggestion of what um people thought would be good books to use for the class and went with her own uh suggestion of a book she had taught before um i knew that book and i knew it was a good book so i wasn't opposed to that uh book and when i was teaching that reading and writing class i just tried to put my own spin on it i had assignments that were a little bit different that hers even though we were teaching the same class we didn't have to do all the same assignments so i tried to make it my own a little bit um we shared how our classes were going and people would try out different things that other teachers were doing so um there was some uh sharing even though the initial uh contribution had been ignored um so the outcome was i think everybody had a good class and then the next time that the next group of people were getting together uh she was a little bit more open and uh somebody else's suggestion that she hadn't taken um the session before uh she decided to make a change and go with something new um and that one was also fine we also you know did the same thing of everybody kind of took it their own we didn't do exactly the same thing as each other so a good outcome
ah the communication problem that i'll talk about was related to retention meetings that we used to have at the end of our uh sessions so the teachers would all get together um to discuss grades final exams scores and whether or not a student would pass on to the next level or be retained and have to repeat a level in our in our language program um the communication problem was that there was sometimes um maybe poor uh record keeping or poor planning in organizing how to get all of the uh information that was used to make those uh retention decisions so um every now and then a mistake would be made you know like um somebody who could have passed would be retained or somebody who should have been retained didn't get retained um because uh it seems like the people who were putting it in the system didn't communicate well with each other so um what i would do and also because the meetings weren't run particularly well it was kind of a free for all everybody uh shouting their um information because they all want just want to leave the meeting as soon as they could so um what i tried to do was i had my list of students that i needed to talk about that were in danger of being retained i had strong feelings on whether or not they should be retained and i made sure to take notes uh when the other instructors who heard those students were talking about them so i would listen to what they were saying um take notes and see if we agreed or not and um when it came down to the end of the meeting i would just make sure that the decision that got recorded went along with the notes that i had taken during the meeting
so i was asked to train a new team member um and was asked to give feedback about how the training was going and it turned out to be uh difficult because it was critical feedback because the person was having a really difficult time uh it just seemed like it wasn't a good fit for the work that needed to be done uh he didn't follow instructions all the time and sometimes he would just ignore what people had asked him to do he would make up uh his own instructions if something didn't go right he didn't ask for help he would just either not do the assignment or do the assignment totally wrong uh because something at the very beginning of the assignment didn't go right um so uhbehaviors i carried out in response to the situation i was um asked very specific questions about his performance so um some emails with specific questions about what he had done and how it was going um a couple of meetings where uh other people who were involved in training this uh person were asked for their opinions about it um so i just answered honestly about what i knew about just the facts of how everything was going on um without talking about the emotional aspect of being frustrating to try to train somebody um that didn't seem like they were listening you know just kind of saying this is the assignment we asked to do this is what didn't go correctly this is the instruction that wasn't followed uh this is what i said to ask to get the assignment redone explaining um where the mistake was and how did we do it um and the time
i was uh teaching some language classes and our uh like our computer person uh for the program gave a presentation about a new um website that teachers could use kind of like a social networking website but for um uh classes so the teacher has the site and the students can go on and um do assignments and interact with each other um and the uh presentation that we went to was pretty high level so some of the fancier things that that uh program was capable of doing um but i was teaching with a small group of um experienced teachers but who were a little afraid of computers so they were a little bit overwhelmed by that presentation we had gone to about all the fancy things that you could do on that website but i had actually used it before um had done some of the fancy things that were in the presentation but there's a lot more a lot more um capabilities that um were pretty simple so what i did was just uh show them the site that i had made for my class before showed them all the simple things that uh it could do things that made it really easy for them like just things like even taking attendance which is not difficult to do at all in that website but something that hadn't been in the presentation so um they were thinking they wouldn't use it at all because they didn't want to do all the you know fancy games um that had demonstrated um or they weren't going to do the kind of assignments that had been uh shown in the presentation but when they saw some things that were pretty useful to them um like putting up your homework assignments on there so that you don't have 20 students emailing you after class saying what's the homework you know they saw the benefit of that so i think they uh got over their fear and decided to try it out
we had a discussion at one of our staff meetings about problems that we were having with the folks in our procurement area because we weren't in sync with how we were handing over our work to them and how they were getting work back to us so a group of us uh decided to become a team to work on this project and we called it the contract pill process uh we had a meeting and we started talking about what the difference pieces were and i said you know i think we really need a grid of some kind so that we can look at all of the different parts of this project and make sure that we don't leave anything out so i sort of mapped out for the group what i thought the grid would look like and over the next actually almost two years we played around with this grid we had discussions with uh people internally and uh i did a lot of proof reading every time we changed the grid there were problems with it and we had to keep adjusting uh the english and the punctuation and grammar and things like that uh and we also periodically met with some of the stakeholders to go over what we were doing uh and i was trying to take a leadership role in that to make sure that we talked to all of the right people and got all the information down that we needed in order to get some agreement so that we could move forward so as i said it took about two years i was not the formal leader of this group uh but i did have a lot to do with making it i think go forward and was trying to make sure that all the people who needed to be involved were included in the decision making the end
um a number of years ago when i worked at prudential i was responsible for the policy issuing and our underwriting department and um i had a group of very low level clerical folks who were pretty much unappreciated in the department because the appreciation was really toward the underwriters who made the decisions on which people could get insurance and which people couldn't and the policy issue people were those who did all the paperwork at the end to make sure that the individual agents got the right policies for their customers and that we were able to make the sale um so what happened was all the work from the underwriters would get dumped on the policy issue people and they had it wasn't exactly service little agreements but there were um some objectives for how much time things were supposed to take and how much fast we were supposed to get the work out of the um out of the office so um the policy issue people knew very specific things that they had to do to prepare to these policies this was long before we had any computerized system doing this so they were actually um standing in front of large um bins and picking actual pages to put in the policy and then inserting them into the policy and the last step in that was to do something called grommeting where we put the policy through a machine to um fix a little metal piece to it so that if a policy holder ripped the policy apart um it would be pretty evident that it happened and this way the pages shouldn't get lost um anyway because i was not um well versed or trained in how to do the policy issue work my job um that i picked uh for when we were working overtime holidays saturdays things like that was to run around and grab all of the policies as the policy issue people finished them run to the grommet machine get them grommeted put the policies in the right place and there was a little counter in the machine so i would call out okay we've done a hundred policies this morning or we've done a hundred and twenty and i would try to keep up the motivation by telling people how much work we had finished in the period of time that we had
i mentioned earlier about the contract pill process that we worked on in uh my area here at ets and when we were doing that project we had several people from our uh contract area and several people from procurement uh and i think that really uh the the contract people had much more investment in this because we were the ones who had to make sure that everything got to the right place when it was all done uh the procurement people have a much lesser role of they obviously put together the purchase order that's very important to uh the external supplier uh but the amount of time and effort that it takes to put the purchase order together is usually much less than the contract manager job so when we were meeting with the people from procurement they uh didn't really seem to think that this was all that important they didn't kind of get why we were having these meetings uh and i guess i spent a fair amount of time trying to talk with them about the work that they do uh ask them how they do the work how they should how they felt they could interface with us and what they thought the good outcome would be uh so that we could all come to a conclusion that would work for both groups uh and so uh we tried to do that in a number of meetings uh sometimes we had meetings just with the contract managers to come up with strategy for how to work with the procurement people in this process uh but in the end i think uh that the three of us on the contract side worked well together in coming up with ideas for how we could uh work better with the other group and then to convince the other group about all the different things we needed to do and get them to review the work uh because one of the problems we were having with them was we would hand over the paperwork the drafts that we had done and it was pretty clear when we met with them that they hadn't looked at any of the drafts so we sort of had to get them to focus and i tried to do that uh personally with them uh to make sure that we were going to meet our objectives and finish this project
i was recently asked by sws here at ets that strategic work force solutions our human resources group uh to negotiate a contract with a person who runs a negotiation company so i knew that this was not going to be easy because i actually had attended this person's class a few years ago and i knew that he was really smart and very well vast in negotiation and i thought oh i'm i trying to negotiate a contract with him to do work here is going to be pretty interesting uh i had received uh this individual's contract which was one page long and my job was to get him to sign our contract which is about twenty pages long with a statement of work that had another probably five or six pages to it uh so you know he had a pretty simple idea of how this might work and we had a much complicated idea uh what i tried to do was to take the information from his one page and incorporate it into ours and make changes to our contract that would make him feel that we were listening to what he was saying uh and in a bit that in a way that kind of back fired because i gave a lot to him before we got started and then when i tried to get from him the things that were important to us he was really fighting back with me uh so in the end uh he got a lot more out of this than we got but i did try by sending him red line agreements by uh explaining things in email and also over the phone to him why these things were important to ets and what we were trying to uh get for us that we thought was not really hurting him uh we did end up signing a contract uh actually a day after this person started here doing the work uh it looks like the work is going to be successful uh and we already paid him a fair amount of money for the first day that he was here so we have a signed contract uh didn't get everything that we wanted but i think in the end uh it will be a good working relationship
i was asked to work on a contract with one of our accounting firms um for some work that they were going to be doing overseas for us and what happened was they gave me a copy of their contract um and asked i was asked to look at it but not spend a lot of time on it and not make a lot of changes to it because our internal finance people really just wanted to get this signed um so i said to them well you know i really need to read the whole thing over and give you my comments and i talked to my senior director about this and we agreed that i would do my normal job of reviewing everything i'll point out all the items that we thought we important and then the finance people would decide which ones they really wanted to go back to the the accounting firm on so i went through everything i had to do it really quickly because they originally gave me about two and a half days to work on this and then came back and said they needed it in a day um and i actually had to negotiate that with my internal client because i had a meeting that morning and i couldn't get this finished until the afternoon but anyway i ended up giving them feedback on ten different pieces of the contract that um my director and i thought were important and i think probably about five of them were actually accepted by the accounting firm uh so that was a good thing they didn't put everything into the agreement the way i was expecting them to do it but they did find a way to insert our comments on that they were agreeable to and i think that we have a pretty good contract with this group um interestingly there were some typos in what the finance people thought was the final agreement and so i pointed out to them where these typos were because i though if this goes up to the vice president and the vice president sees these mistakes i'm going to be blamed for it so i wanted to be sure that this was a good document uh that everybody could live with in the end um and i'm waiting now for the um vice president at ets to sign off on the contract so that they can start the work
well i had many opportunities to try to persuade people about things and to put proposals together uh i guess uh we're working right now on all of our high holiday preparations uh at our synagogue and i have a lot to do with our ritual committee um and i do a lot of the background work so that all of the uh preparation the tickets the letters to go out to the congregation that all those things uh get done properly and uh in the past uh when i was working on those letters i sometimes had to negotiate with our rabbi or with our kantra on what some of the wording would be um how we were going to put this together and um and when we had a new rabbi come a few years ago i showed him the letters and i said i think we really need to make this first letter much shorter so i showed him where i thought that we could extract information or delete information so that we could get this to a shorter uh page number number of pages um and he was agreeable to do that which made me very happy so uh we made the deletions we got this letter down to about four pages it used to be five pages i'm pretty sure that most people don't read the letter when they get it so i feel bad about that because we do do a lot of work on it uh but the letter does go out and will be going out actually the letter went out uh last week for this year's high holidays and that's the end of my story
we've probably all experienced working for a boss that we didn't like or uh in some ways didn't respect very much uh and when i worked at city group i worked for about six months under a person who uh came to us on halloween and we decided that she was a witch uh we really did not like working with her uh and what we found was she always thought that she was right about everything uh she worked about twenty five hours everyday and expected the rest of us to do that as well and uh she watched over us made comments that we stayed at lunch too long or left work on what she thought was early when actually it was not usually early uh and she i guess the hardest thing for us was that she would give us multiple projects to work on and never prioritized which one she wanted done first so i would say to her well you know i have three projects here that you want me to do which one is the most important? and her answer usually was they're all important and you have to do all of them immediately uh so what i did was just use my best judgment in that case to try to get things done as quickly as i could uh and hand them over to her and say you know here we are this one is done i'll work on the next one uh that was kind of the only way that i could get through working with her because i'm a person who likes very much to have organization and i felt like i couldn't work on three things at once uh in the way that she wanted me to do because i wasn't going to get them all done at the same time uh so anyway uh there was one day when uh this person asked me to update some powerpoint presentations that i had previously done and i asked her when she needed them and she said she needed them that day including some new ones that i hadn't ever worked on before uh but i was really proud of myself that i got them all done in the time frame that she requested and i realized the next day when i was down sized that the reason that donna needed all of this stuff was that i wasn't going to be there anymore and she wanted it all finished before i left so that was kind of interesting uh but i felt like i was very much freed from uh captivity when i wasn't having to work with her anymore
uh this question is about being given more than your share of unpleasant tasks and i guess i wouldn't really say this was an unpleasant task but it was something i was hoping that we wouldn't have to do um we have a file room in our area and the file room kept getting full and they had to um bring in more file cabinets and move things outside of the file room so we finally uh were told that we were going to have a file cleanup day and i got really nervous about this because we were each going to be given uh a shelf of files and that meant that my files were interspersed among all of the people who were going to do this project and i was a little bit nervous about what was going to happen to the files that i'm responsible for so the first thing that i did was i ran into the file room i grabbed all my really important files i put them on my desk and i said i'll do these myself um and then on the day of file cleanup we had all of our instructions what we were supposed to do um and i ran into the file room grabbed part of the a shelf full of files went back to my desk and organized all over my desk um different piles so that i wouldn't get things confused um and i spent the day working on this i thought that it was going to take about two hours to do the file room cleanup my part of it but it actually took the entire day and we almost didn't finish by the end of the day um which was kind of scary um but anyway i was happy with the job i did i thought that i did a good job of cleaning the files i mean it's not really super hard however um you would think that this would have been a fairly easy task for everybody and every time i go into the file room now and pull out the folders that i need i find mistakes they're not filed right there are things in the wrong places um there are wrong years written on the folders so it's a little bit frustrating that not that the entire group didn't take it as seriously as i think they should have um but at least i know that uh when i grab the folders the new folders that i haven't touched before um that i'm able to put them in the right order now and um hopefully none of our files will be missing
uh one of the people that i worked under at prudential um was that the vice president of our uh procurement area and i started working under her um one year that i've worked directly for the vice another vice president and they um changed the organization so now i was working for this woman mary um and i thought that was going to be okay until i started going to her staff meetings and realized that whenever mary posed a problem and i gave a suggestion for how it might be solved she totally dismissed it um she never listened to any of the ideas that i had and i sort of sat around sat in the room looking around realizing that nobody else was ever making any suggestions and that they were kind of the stepford wives you know they were all just um you know in this meeting and looking at mary thinking that she was wonderful and not really offering very much in the way of suggestions or ideas so um after a while of feeling like i was batting my head against the wall i decided maybe i should just stop making suggestions because she's not going to be listening to them anyway and um even though in retrospect and as i'm saying this it doesn't sound like that was a really good idea to do um it really made me feel better because i felt like you know at least i wasn't putting myself out there and being beaten up every time i try to um give an idea or not so much beaten up but really more ignored um i didn't feel that that felt good so i decided if i just kept quiet about things and did my job and didn't offer suggestions that probably everybody could be happier so that was the outcome of that
when i was um an associate manager at prudential i was offered the opportunity to attend the train the trainers session for our premier management training program and some of the people who were in the train the trainer session had actually attended the management training program as participants and about half of us had not attended in the past and i was in the group that had never been through this workshop so not only were we being asked to learn how to train the workshop but we really had to understand the content of the workshop at the same time um there was an activity that we were doing um that talked about goals and objectives and they had two people go up to the front of the room actually it was three it was um the seller and two buyers in this exercise and they were the seller was trying to sell an orange and the two buyers were trying to each buy the orange for very good humanitarian reasons and they each had their own little script and at one point while they were talking i heard distinctly that one of the people said i need the juice of the orange and the other person wasn't picking up on it and so i wasn't actually in the middle of doing this um exercise i was watching it but i realized oh the other person needs the right of the orange and that is the solution to the whole problem they can share the orange because each of them needs a different part so um in my work and in my um whole life i try very hard to listen carefully when people are talking because many times there is a clue even if it's a very small clue in what they are saying that helps you to solve a problem later on um because you've listened carefully and you've detected some little piece of information that maybe other people have not found
i guess uh in my work life i've always tried to avoid having difficult situations happen so that that then i don't have to tell my boss about the difficult problem that's occurred or that i can go in and say this is a problem that we potentially had but we've resolved it we've gotten around it uh i did have a boss once who uh we were in a line division at prudential there were about fifty people pip paying claims in our group there was a claims supervisor who had been there for many years and she was very knowledgeable about the work uh i was more of an administrative person as was my boss my boss never had anything on his desk he had a black desk with a black water and you never saw a white piece of paper on his desk so you can imagine how he felt when he looked out of the office of his window at this  claim supervisor who's desk was fully covered with paper large piles of staff books all kinds of things all over her desk and it made him crazy so he came to me one day and he said tome you have to get terry to clean her desk and i basically said to him there is really no way that i'm going to be able to get her to clean that desk she knows where everything is she can get her hands on things immediately and i know that's not the way that you work or the way that you would like your desk to look but it works for her and i don't think we're going to change her after all these years so i think he wasn't really happy with what i said to him but terry got to keep her desk the way it was
i don't know if you've ever um had any experience with a system called docusign which is a document signature system that we adopted a couple of years ago here at ets and all of our contracts go through the docusign system to be fully executed and it's great because in the end everybody can get a copy of um everybody who you want to can get a copy of the executed agreement um what we learned was there were other uses for docusign it didn't have to be just document signatures there could be other things that we could do with it um so i uh teamed up with a person in our group who really is the docusign expert the person who negotiated the contract with docusign and he and i have been doing some special projects to try to figure out how we can use docusign to streamline some of our other work one of the things that we came up with was sending out our supplier forms that we need for accounts payable and for our contract management system to our suppliers through docusign and so uh bill and i spent quite a bit of time going over all the forms coming up with um revisions to the forms that would make sense when they were in docusign um and then and we had to negotiate that with the owners of the forms and then when we were all done um when we came up with the process we had to present this to our group to procurement and also the contract managers um what bill and i did before that was we knew that everything was set in the docusign system but we sat down just the two of us and rehearsed how we were going to do this exactly what order we were going to do it in how he and i would show the different pieces of the system and the different um uh people who would be involved and how they would fill out the forms electronically um and we had to this to our group with our group who of course sat there and said it's a whole lot easier for just for us just to email these things than it is to put this docusign thing together um so we had some um push push back from people on using this in the first place but fortunately our management was really behind it and we do have our whole group now using docusign for supplier forms and also for our uh customer satisfaction surveys
so currently i am an administrative assistant to the vice president and as the admin to the vp um there are many situations that come up that i am asked to do a follow up um and help the leader of the project with deliverables uh time-frames i help focus the leader on um providing the input needed from an executive uh view point uh my role usually is as a support person however it is an important role uh it does provide me with um more of a background on what the project is i become much more integrated in the development project and usually it comes um as a learning experience for all sorts
so i am the liaison for ets cares for my department corporate accounting uh and uh when i began at ets in twenty-twelve uh i was told that uh i would lead the department and uh be the liaison for corporate accounting and so i came up with some pretty um interesting ideas the department i work in uh really needed a cheer leader and uh to get them motivated to participate uh and i am very proud to say that in the last two years uh we've been number one in finance uh i have done things like uh donated uh bags of potato chips and the people had put in the ets cares piggy bank uh money to get back the potato chips so that kind of brought our uh donations up and we had a uh dress-down day uh where they could wear like the college sweat shirt or anything of their choice uh for the day for a certain theme uh and that also brought our donations up uh on behalf of our department so it's been a very positive uh ets cares uh donation
so about uh twelve years ago i worked at um a company where the project lead and his boss were not on the same page um and it was a lot of um tension and so uh each one would come to me complaining about the other um i made it a point of not taking sides i thought it was best that i just remain neutral about the situation um if one of them started um saying things about the other that i did not think was professional i just nicely told them to leave me out of it i did not want to be involved um it really did get to a point where it was unprofessional and um so i just made sure that both of them were aware that i did not want to be involved
so as a new employee um one of the things that uh i had to do was gain the trust of my department um and just so they would know my capabilities what i can do what i can uh do as i represent them outside the department um so one of my attributes i guess is that uh i have patience and i listen to people's concerns uh what they are looking for their needs and then i make sure that i um do whatever background uh information that i can get my hands on so that they understand um that my skills my background uh i can absolutely do the job that needs to be done and it's been a pretty positive um outcome the few times that i started a new job
so i worked in as a project management coordinator uh about mmm thirteen years ago and uh one of the tasks uh i had or one of the projects i was assigned is to uh supervise and help close twenty projects that were outstanding uh in one year and so when i took a look at some of the projects uh that the department wanted closed i realized that between uh the lack of personnel or the personnel that we had there were on vacation uh there was a lot of uh people who were unable to help provide the support that was needed uh and so i sat down with my department division manager and we went through and we picked the ones that we knew we could uh close that year and then we put a project plan in place for the other uh projects so in that year we were able to close twelve projects and the other eight were closed the following year uh so it wasn't the twenty in one year that uh the department manager wanted but we did get twenty in two years
so i put together a proposal on a process improvement project um and before i presented it i did a lot of background and research on how this process would help stream line the department um  it would cut back on errors done it would also um give the group um more time to work on other projects uh and provide uh financial improvement so i saved about uh two hundred and fifty thousand um with this process improvement and it was something that i presented to the entire department um first i presented it to my manager um and then i presented it to um his direct reports um and then i presented it to the entire department to get feedback because they are the end users so i needed to know if there was something that i was missing but um  we did implement the process and um i actually got an award for it so it makes me proud
so um i work with many different personalities and so um within my spectrum um i need to be able to interact with all different types so we have um people who are very detailed um and people who are more um laid back and just um relaxed about uh things so when i try to adjust my personalities so that um when i'm working with different personality types i can um absolutely work with them on a professional level uh and deal with um the different levels of uh i've worked with everyone from someone who is very very detailed oriented to someone who is kind of doesn't very relaxed and doesn't really look at the nature of details so um i've successfully worked with them uh and i keep it strictly professional depending on the personality type uh but um overall i say it was a successful blending um i knew that um the people who were more detail oriented um just needed uh to know that i could provide the support that they needed um so i've never had an issue with interacting with different personality types
so um the task that uh in the past that i've handled was uh providing um ids the stars on new employees and um it's one of those that is a necessary task that needs to be done um and so i made sure i always tracked uh the number of ids that i did versus the amount that was handed out that day so if there was uh twenty that were handed out and i did fifteen then i would absolutely call a meeting uh depending on if this was a consistent um day after day situation um and then i would make sure that the group understood that this was a shared task um and that we really needed  to uh get together as a team to make sure that these task weren't just handed onto one person and didn't necessarily have to be myself um if i saw the task was being primarily handled by another person i would um make sure that the team was aware of this and as a group um carried out the um task
so i had a manager one time uh who um ignored the um standard operating procedure that they had just um published and signed off on so um i privately made an appointment with this person um and privately um just wanted to discuss uh the procedure and i wanted them to help me understand what had happened um it turns out that uh the person just was not even aware that they had just broken their own procedure um so the situation was um rectified and the manager actually uh put out an apology to the group um and acknowledging that um they went against standard operating procedure but i wasn't sure at the time that i had done the right thing um by going to them and to just point out an error but they handled it well and it was uh absolutely rectified
so there was an issue that came up um when a manager uh sent out an email to the entire department uh almost reprimanding them uh and so a few people came to me and asked me what's going on? so i went to the manager and sat down uh with him and just said help me understand uh what happened here they started uh talking to me about the issue and how unhappy they were with this issue so i didn't say anything but just kind of let them uh vent and it turns out that the person wasn't so much uh i don't want to say angry but uh turns out it was more a uh de-concern for the department and what was going on and so i worked with this person on uh making sure that uh the communications were uh sent out that contained a hostile message so i wanted this person to understand as i listened to them and i grew to understand where their concerns were coming from that maybe we could draft up a different kind of communication for the department uh which they did uh with my help
so um there have been a lot of times that um i've been asked to provide feedback for my immediate supervisor um and especially as an administrative assistantum  you have a different working relationship with a person um you get to know them on the business side and also on a personal side too um so it never fails that they will ask for feedback um  from me in some form or another either informally or formally um and so i'm always open and honest with them um but i remain professional uh i like to joke and kid but if they are asking me or i'm providing their supervising feedback on them i do keep it professional um i don't bring up you know uh they were in a bad mood on such and such a day um  i do listen to what the department says but i don't let it influence me their interaction with other people um how they are with them as a manager not just with me but with their direct in um so  i try to let them know what the positive outcome and some of their strengths and some things they can improve on i have one supervisor who just did not want to interact with people and so i told her that it was important that her department got to know her on a regular basis
so i have recently uh began uh transitioning some of the forms that we have uh within my department um into infopath forms put on share point and so um i had i could correspond with one of my co-workers to help them understand infopath forms because uh they really wanted to get to uh work with it and use it but they had no idea on how to uh use the actual program itself so i thought it was best to have me make sometime sit down with the computer and go through step by step what i did uh to create a form in infopath to put on to share point uh this person doesn't uh have a strong background in uh programs he knows excel very well but uh infopath is not something that someone knows a lot of and so especially when you are dealing with uh different financial forms then you want to make sure that certain things get in certain things aren't so as we are going through and this is an on going project so uh i'm supporting her and what she needs and uh so she's starting to get her forms together with my help and it's working out beautifully
so five years back when my job was moved outsource to accenture i was moved to another group which was uh totally different from my previous group so i was trained for the new work while i was getting trained i noticed that they had all the documents or uh all the files located in share drives which was not version controlled and not secure as well and i came from a group where we were using share-point for all for the security and version control features so i mentioned it to my manager should i try to bring that here as well in this group and uh the group was about maybe 18 people in the team and my manager said okay you take a lead leadership of this uh task and go ahead with it so i met with each and every member of the team i showed them what we can do and why we should move on to share-point is because we can use if somebody makes a change and we can go back and check different previous versions we can uh these files which are in share-point sites are very secure so i met with each of them got a rubber file structure and designed a share-point site for them although right now you would see there is a lot of assistance provided if you have to do the same task but five years back there was not much assistance so i was knocking on every door that i could get the information work with the entire team one on one and also with the whole group as to uh this is how the design looks like would you be like would you like me to make any changes? are you comfortable using it? so the whole transition from share drives to share-point was the task that i took on my own and worked as a leader trained the entire team to use it they are comfortably using it right now
two-thousand eleven i was working on a six sigma project and my project was to find out what are the tasks which are been done repeatedly in two groups because under my group there were packaging and package testing groups so what are the tasks that they are repeating in both the groups because we were separated before so we were uh doing some of the things which are uh repeated kind of so the two both the entire both the teams were doing the same task so i was supposed to meet both the teams and find out why they were doing that and what we can eliminate or add to save some time and also save resources in doing the task which is not necessary during that time we figured that there were lot of issues because we were saying that this task takes this much time and then we came up with in the team meetings we came up with other situation where it was taking long for the team to handle the work because of the issues coming from different departments i won't say exactly the department but i can give an example like i-base or ad or it those kind of places the issues were uh rooting out from so i worked with the team and i said how can we handle the situation where we can eliminate that as well we can reach out to these departments and ask them and show them actual data as to what we are having problems with maybe they can find out the solution maybe we won't have those problems again so the team said okay we have we need all these information to uh put it into a database and pull the data and send it to different groups and uh you know maybe in quarterly basis we can reach out to other groups so i sat with the team built uh msac access application where they provided me with the information that they would like to save and i created that application and i showed them how they can fetch data i wrote them sequels from there they could fetch data for on quarterly basis and reach out to different groups and send them to uh keep track a of what is going on how things need to be improved at their end to help us at the end so this has been used for maybe more than three years now and their task is getting easier and easier day by day as other groups are being formed now
working for uh more than eleven years at ets or twelve years at ets i have seen from time to time people who are not very happy with what with their situation or not very happy working with others in general or maybe with someone so but then when i approach them my approach is like maybe you would think that it is a friendly approach but it is i would talk um to the person about work and no matter how i can get the information from the person and sometimes what i do is if it is work related and it needs to be done i sit with both first people um separately not in the same room because i tried that in the same room and talking to both of them at the same time and sometimes it didn't work out what it was the tension they had or whatever background they had with each other uh would not let them work together so i would try to sit with each of them separately get the information get the work done uh handle them separately instead of putting them in the same group in the same room and handle them together at the same time because no matter what sometimes you just cannot make the person change their behavior the work needs to be done and that i take care of that it is getting done um it's the approach that i take that i get the information from both the parties and put it together make sure that they are not offended by what i'm trying to do um get their permission to do that and explain to them the reason for doing that that's all about it
so january of twenty twelve we had uh a new application that came out ipackager which was replacing test prep uh the team it team who developed it gave us a training for two days on how to use this new application and how to move on from test prep to ipackager but there was a feature auto clone which was not incorporated in that release in january of twenty-twelve although it came in at the end of the year by the end of the year we got that auto clone feature without that auto clone feature what we had to do is to build a package a test package there were more than two hundred fields that need to be filled with data and when i sat for the two-day training i figured that it's going to take forever for every person in the team to do it manually enter two hundred fields to build one test package it's very time consuming there can be human errors so i planned to automate the whole process but since it was all production involvement people were not willing to take it uh take my idea of uh  automating the whole process so i asked them for two days two weeks and build my code in uh some test which is like sequence plus code and did a demo for the it team who developed the ipackager application when i showed them what it can do how it can take all the data from test prep and put it in ipackager which uh uh manually a person may take more than two days to build one package my code was taking thirty minutes to build the entire package when i gave them the demo they were one hundred percent convinced that this is the best approach to take and since they were uhconvinced by my idea my team had to take it because it was coming now from it group as to take it so the whole team agreed to use the uh script that i built for them and the entire year the whole my code was used to built over six hundred packages by using the automation process
so i was since i knew access development there was an application or is an application to support ap chinese and japanese uh dashboard creation that is been created from that application and the team who developed it the person who developed it or the people who are using the reports dashboards to send out to the vps or the executive managers for at the end of the day they were not um working together well so i was given this project and told take care of it but when i entered the room where the parties were looking at each other and saying we want this and the other one was this is not possible and that kind of situation i started arranging meetings with them and taking meeting notes uh sharing with the teams and asking them about what changes they would like to have and how much time i have or this person have to provide those changes to the application we uh came to a mutually favorable outcome was that we can provide them with certain features but not all of them and at the end of the maybe march or february we start sending february or march we start sending the dashboards by then we had everything ready and then after may when we had more time we started working on the new features that they were asking for and that they asked for before so that way i had documented everything all the meeting minutes the current working of the application the new uh uh add-ons that they wanted new uh features that they wanted i documented everything and the task was taken very smoothly from there on after we started meeting and getting together in the meeting rooms and doing the brain storming sessions
a year ago i was moved on to mumble production group where i noticed that uh many reports were built on most on a weekly basis or some are built daily basis to report the status of different uh test centers administering all over the world there are more than five thousand test centers and how they are been utilized to save on the rebates for ets they are being created and uh the uh management of those test centers are to be taken care based on those reports when i noticed that how long a person sits and makes the report by fetching data from different sources putting them together doing the uh capacity utilization percentages and uh showing the uh different colors for uh different percentages like if it is greater than seventy showing red or if it is greater than sixty show it yellow something like that when i sat with a couple of people and i noticed how much time they are spending on it i came up with an idea of writing macros for report creation in the beginning they were a little hesitant about using them because it would take away their manual task it will not let the new person know what exactly we are doing just like clicking on a mac you know click run a macro one click and it will do the work which they are spending hours and hours will be done in a second it was hard to convince the team the people who were using it one by one i started talking to them giving them a demo showing them what i can do to help them documenting the steps for them uh actually commenting my codes so that they can even read and uh make little changes like uh and a several being at some place and then re-run it again so showing them small little stuff how it can be used now they are using it for a while
so at ets we work with the diverse group of people and everybody um if they have a different cultural background their way of handling situation is different than my way so i take that into consideration sometimes when i approach somebody and i feel like they don't want to interact with me or help me or are extremely busy um i understand their situation and i give them sometime and instead of i'm a person who would walk to the person and talk instead of doing that if i see there is a problem with that i would document things i would write in an e-mail and um send an e-mail to the person um maybe one time two time if i don't get a response i would approach the person walk again or give a call try to get the work done no matter what it is i mean we all have differences but if the work needs to be done it needs to be done that's how i take it so for me i get paid for the work i'm doing here um i live the cultural background or the differences of opinion or other personal matters stuff aside and concentrate on the work um it's not very difficult to get the work done if you can put down in a um bullet form this is what i need this is what i need and please provide me if that is your approach which is not um too much for the other person to drop what they are doing right away and give it to you then they will definitely get back to you and uh you can get the work done so that's the main purpose to be here that's what i concentrate on
well most of the time i'm not aware of what other employees are doing even if they are in my team so i cannot compare the situation and uh any task which is tedious boring or physically demanding since i can code i try to make it not tedious not boring or not physically demanding i try to automate the processes and i shouldn't be telling you but i do it click and i can walk away take a break and come when the work is done that's the kind of background i have um but uh if the task is too much then i try working from home in the week in the evenings or in the weekends and i do at my own schedule so it's  i never felt more than 12 years at ets  i never felt i was given more than that i could handle in seven days a week i mean i can work a little bit over the weekend and in the evenings so and the task that i get if it is tedious boring physically demanding i find out a way to make it interesting for me because when i write code and i it starts working i feel happy to look at it and to see how um successfully i'm handling the job like a little task of um putting the keys on um we had a huge list of thousand of uh test center administrators and if the e-mail address is same then we have to put the one two three four and others suppose the fifth e-mail address is different we have to put number five there i spend maybe two hours to write a macro but it one click and it just looks at uh a match or if it sees an exact mark with the previous record it just puts like the numbering one two three four and then the next fifth one is not a match it will put one there so that was the code and so i enjoy doing what i'm doing i never feel that it was overwhelming for me at ets ever
leadership of a group project i can't remember seeing the situation like that where somebody would ignore the contributions that were not in accordance with his or her own opinion because if it is if the contributions are required by the project a person cannot just say that this is not required bringing his or her own opinion i would say every project which is to be built is like it has uh guidelines in the beginning as to what is expected out of the project so no one person had the would can take that authority to do that in a group project and i've never seen it happening before but if i ever see it happening i can talk to the person and uh maybe remind the person again about what was expected out of the project and should why are we ignoring that that feature or the contributions of others which are a part of the project other than reminding the person taking back to the documentation which asked for those features i can uh not change the opinion of the leader who has taken on the project but i would try my best to not let it go and talk to the person and see where it takes
i think listening skills are more required than speaking skills when it comes to situations like i was in lately there is an application which is developed in ms access uh by some other team member and i was told by that team member to take care of uh the closed cprs or you can say closed tickets pull the closed tickets out of the database and uh put it in a text txt format and give it to another team which was taking which had built another application where they wanted it in txt format and then the special type of uh delimiter that they wanted it and the special uh fields that they wanted in a special format so when it was given to me i was overwhelmed with work i mean i was a hundred percent occupied with my work but this was like given to me okay take care of it and it has to be done in two days and when i asked the person have you ever done it before the person mentioned yeah it can be done through task scheduler and i have to uh i had to confess at that time i haven't used task scheduler before could you please help me with that and the person was not willing to because she was also occupied too much with her work so i spoke to the developer person in the other group and i sat with them i said you tell me what you want how do you want when we sat together and came up with uh the information was thrown from both the groups as to what actually they want the person who developed it and the people who needed the data they i was like just a person who was talking to both the teams and the people who needed it they said we will take care of the data just give us access to your app to your database and when i provided the access they said don't worry about it we will take care of it so i went in their meetings listened to both the groups uh came up with a solution of how to give them access so that it can be done
so at ets uh or i think at every other workplace you would definitely see some uhpeople who click very well and some people who just cannot uh one of the situations i was in was i developed ms access application where the data needs to be input by the team members on a package is built but there were these problems and these problems took this long to be handled and this is where the problem erupted from so uh the manager put on person uh to take care of the situation like enter data you are the person who will enter the data we could tell the situation was like  she wanted to promote the person she liked the person and she wanted to do it fine that happens everywhere and i see it around happening all the time but then the other team members started coming to me and saying the data which is being put in is incorrect and we will look bad if this data goes out of our team we are saying incorrect things here what to do so i approached my manager and i tried to explain to her about the situation we know that this person uh is very knowledgeable but also he's knowledgeable on his on program but he is not working on other programs so how about we give this task to everybody in the team whoever is a lead of particular program like if he is toeic lead so he can do only for toeic because he would understand toeic better than toefl gre hiset so how about the lead should be allowed to do that and it was a difficult communication i would say because i find it more difficult when i see that the manager is trying to do something and we can see it's coming but the approach is incorrect so they have all the authority to do whatever they want but she was convinced by it and other team members were given access to the application
so i have learned this a very hard way about explaining technical or complex um idea to non-technical and unfamiliar audience in the beginning i used to write an e-mail and i would that the person understood it but you know when you read something what you have written it makes sense for you but then when the other person reads it sometimes it's hard for them and particularly when they are not very technical or not even that but i feel that there are all kinds of people some are very aggressive in learning something new others are very um slow and don't care and like we are all working for a place where it doesn't matter whether you take something new or you don't so people are sometimes kind of door closed i don't want to take anything new so they will come out and say i don't know what you are saying you do it yourself um because we know we see all around what's going on is you don't take anything new nothing happens to you you sit here you retire after you turn sixty-five seventy so sometimes it's really hard to approach non-technical or unfamiliar audience when they are not willing to accept or learn something new so instead of putting just an e-mail now i keep walking to the person i keep going to their desk and show them again and again the same thing and i control my own what do you say um uh frustration and just keep going to the person and helping this person with same stuff although they can write the steps and do it again but they don't because of the situation that we are at ets so i keep doing that again and again try to look a good person
um one of my previous jobs i worked as a financial analyst and the job was basically related to finance um i wasn't i was just one of the analysts in a group of about eight analysts and we were all equal no uh the leaders were the managers and um actually i did not have or nobody in the group had an incentive to do anything out of the box um since everybody's birthdays were coming up and we did not have any formal process for celebrating to take care of um any of the events coming up um i volunteered to take a lead and myself nominated myself to uh go ahead and start celebrating and organizing everybody's birthdays slowly it became a trend and we had a calendar we had a formal calendar where we put and everybody's birthdays we went as a whole group we celebrated the birthdays uh this was not in my job title or not in my job description but still um i felt pretty comfortable taking it and then everybody started enjoying it a lot uh we celebrated not only the celebrations did not only make the person whose birthday was feel good but also bring it bring together the whole group together uh made us feel more like a family uh that everybody cared for each other so i believe i proved to be a leader in initiating the task and um bringing it through every month every year um proved myself a leader although i was not nominated as a leader initially and that was not in my job description
there was a situation where uh we were there was a presentation coming up for a board meeting and uh it was in a very short time frame we weren't sure if our team will be able to uh perform the whole pre uh create the whole presentation and make informant and correctly make it presentable and be able to present it to the board um it was a very difficult enchanting task and we weren't sure but we decided we as a group decided to take the challenge um once we took the challenge halfway through the week we were given one week halfway through the week um one of my uh co-workers was sick it was a group of five of us um and one of them was sick the other one had to leave due to his personal reasons had to take a personal leave so our group was down to three and it was a very difficult uh it was a lot of work to do in a very short period of time so what we decided was um we will split the group one of my colleagues was not very comfortable and she was ready to give up and just go back to management and tell them we were that we won't able to finish the task but uh i kind of encouraged her and we tried to analyze the workload we split it uh evenly and whoever was able to willingly take more load was um welcomed to do so and we somehow we worked through the task we got the whole presentation prepared everything was done in time uh before the deadline and we checked it uh did the quality check everything was done and in the end the management team was happy about it uh the co-worker was also very pleased that we were able to do it she thanked me for it
while i was doing my mba in my uh in one of the semesters we were working on a case study where a group of four of us were supposed to uh take a case analyze it and uh find a solution to the case it was a real life case study and there was no one right answer so it was a difficult situation where uh we can there anybody had a say everybody in the group had a say on what they thought but two of the two members in our group had very conflicting views and they were both very adequately uh stuck to the viewpoint they weren't very comfortable accepting the fact that well the answers could be right so um in order to come up with a solution although there was no one right solution it was difficult to um convince both of them that they were both right at the same time we had to pick one answer um initially they did not get along at all so they did not even like talking to each other so what we had to do was we decided to we had to write a paper in order to put the solutions what we decided was we started we split the responsibilities we gave them we gave one of them the the initial summary and we gave the other person only the um um responsibility to go through and make sure that everything in the paper looked correct and then we came up with a solution where we put in all the view points we had two different view points we put both of them as a possible solution and finished the paper they were both happy and at the end um the guy who was supposed to do the quality check did that and the paper got an a so
uh when i was planning to go on a maternity leave at my work uh we weren't given laptops and uh it was not possible for me to drive i have a long ride back and forth to work so it was difficult for me to try to convince my manager that i really needed a laptop so i can work from home uh because i had a long time before my baby was due and it was kind of difficult for me to commute so and i wasn't being i didn't have that long of a maternity leave that i can take before the baby was born so uh but i and i realized one of the reasons that my manager was the senior management was giving everybody the luxury to have a laptop was because they weren't sure uh if there was going to be any misuse of time and if the employee would be working honestly the whole time from home uh as opposed to when they are at work and uh it was difficult for me initially to negotiate and to convince my manager uh and my manager's manager that i will be that giving me a laptop wouldn't be a wrong idea but it would but i had to find a solution solutions to what i did was i asked them to give me a temporary laptop for a few days and check it out on how if there was any difference in my work progress initially they they checked my time they saw that the whole work was done well and efficiently and they were happy about it so in the end they ended up giving me a laptop and my deal was done
um at one of my previous jobs um my i was working while i was working i was doing full time schooling so it was difficult for me to commute and uh concentrate on my studies at the same time uh carry on my internship it was an internship the manager wanted me to work full time for the internship and i was i did not have enough time for studies in that case and i did not want my education was my prime my main goal at the time and internship was just there to back up my uh education just to enrich my education so i asked the manager to limit my work time to only a few days a week the manager was not very convinced she wanted me to come every day and be present at the work every day so i don't miss any um do not miss anything that's going on in the office in the time frame that i'm absent so we and i was totally stressed out to go to work everyday full time it was difficult so what i did was we negotiated and uh  although i did not want to go everyday and the manager wanted me to go every day full-time we came to a bargain i mean i bargained and she bargained and we came to a conclusion where i could work only few hours everyday so we decided i would work only three hours a day um and it worked well with me because all i had to do was just wake up early in the morning earlier than my normal time and compensate and that time was compensated uh with the whole week so it kind of worked well
uh initially when i joined uh my first job after school it was a very different industry and uh the person who was hiring me had no idea on why i would want to go work for them uh being a different industry and different education background it was a fashion industry my education was related to finance so i had to convince the person now the position was for finance uh it was finance manager position and i was very interested in the position but it was in a fashion industry and i had no background no idea it was in the heart of manhattan uh that every person who had worked there before me had very strong background in fashion industry they knew exactly how everything was priced how every how the royalties were calculated and all the details about fashion industry uh so i had to convince my manager on that i should be a good candidate and that was a time that there was the depression where there were literally hundreds of applicants competing uh for the same job uh what i did was i asked the manager to ask me any questions related to finance i asked him that and i convinced him that uh if anybody else can do the job i can do the job uh because it is a different industry it doesn't mean that i cannot find out in fact it would be a more it would be a better opportunity for me to learn more about the new industry and fashion being uh an industry where time is everything so i was at the verge of it
and on the previous uh job positions that i had uh it was an internship position and my manager was very very mean to me uh he he kind of he overused my abilities to efficiently perform the task so he would give me five six times more workload than a normal intern would get for working the same position and uh i knew he was doing that and that kind of made me mad and drove me nuts but at the same time what i saw was when he gave me more work meant i got more experience and it was only for a short time frame  so uh i did not even like talking to the person because he was very rude but what i did was i just ignored his rudeness and i carried on the job thinking that it was in my benefit to uh do more stuff that he is not doing and learning more learning more would help me develop more skills on the long run so i ignored his rudeness um i just spoke to the point do not try try to not to get into any conflicts with him um you know never tried to uh argue or never try to get into any conflicts because i knew i knew which topics would initiate conflicts and uh i was trying to avoid it as much as possible i just tried to stay to the point got my work done whatever he gave me he was happy with it i was happy with itum i didn't think it was necessary for me to be friends with him that's it
when i was in uh high school as a part-time job i was a cashier at a grocery store uh grocery stores are very busy during christmas during the holiday season and uh i was quite young and initiative to be willing to work whenever they gave me hours uh to work uh initially i did not realize but then later on i realized my manager was uh favoring certain people over me and she tried to give them holidays on days when it wasn't going to be very busy and on light days she gave them longer hours to work whereas um she did the other way round to me uh it got very tiring on certain days you know standing alone it was physically tiring mentally it was tiring i had no idea initially what she was doing but then as i found out that she was cheating on me and she was giving me longer hours on days where there was more work and that she gave me time off when it was low uh i was kind of mad initially i did not like that but then i just negotiated with her i asked her to uh i requested her to take offs or give me limited hours on those busy days and not overuse my hours on those busy days she realized that i was i found out about her being uh her favoritism and so she tried to minimize it but i was quite open and frank to her and i did not want her to uh i did not want anybody else to say what i was feeling to her i just went openly directly communicated to her we were good she was being fair to me
when i was in uh when i was in college we had group studies where we were given projects and we were asked to come up with a solution we the while giving the project the professor nominated a group leader in each group and i was a member of six uh it was a group of six of us one of the person was nominated as the leader and he did exactly uh what a very selfish leader would do he ignored what anybody to say against him or which was not in accordance with his opinion and he just tried to drive as fast as he can in the direction in which he wanted to go he did not care about what anybody thought about other thoughts or other opinions so initially it was annoying because the person was very mean and he was really just rudely had the attitude of it's my way or the high way but then uh we tried to convince him initially that you know what you're doing is wrong but he did not barge to what we were saying so one fine day all everybody else in the group we got together and we clearly mentioned to him that if he did not take everybody's opinion into consideration and equally did not uh obey everybody's opinion then he does not deserve to be a leader and that we'll expel him to be from been our leader we discussed our situation with our professor and professor agreed and the person had to finally give up and uh match to everybody's thoughts and we had the project done successfully later on with his leadership
uh usually sometimes what happens during communication is uh during big meetings is people tend to print what they think they want to hear as opposed to what the person trying to communicate is trying to communicate uh we had once a situation where uh during a meeting one of the managers had uh communicated to everybody the policies and procedures and uh one of my co-workers was she tried to interpret what the manager was saying in accordance to what she what benefited her as opposed to what the manager was saying it should be which are two separate things uh but i believe she wasn't able to separate or clearly understand what the manager was trying to say because she kept thinking in one direction so she kept interpreting what the manager said in accordance to what she wanted to hear uh and it was tough to first convince her initial convince her that what she was what she understood was wrong uh so what we did was we went to the manager we asked the manager to repeat and clarify what he or she what he was trying to say and uh he went and he he went back to the meeting notes and he clearly uh clarified that he was trying to mention particular facts as opposed to interpretation of what my colleague was trying to understand uh it was clear later on but uh sometimes did problems do occur i believe when listening
uh every year during uh during the end of the year when financials are released uh before financials are released the senior management looks at the looks at the financial reports and decide on how much uh bonus or how much compensation everybody would get receive uh one year there was and these reports are created by a team they were created by our team uh one of the one year we i remember we received wrong data from it which we created wrong information and the senior management was about to communicate uh bonuses based on those numbers which we realized were highly inflated uh which meant that once the senior if the senior management had announced something they were going to be in big trouble because there was the money to give out to the to everybody else in the company so it was tough for me to go my manager and tell him that the the numbers we provided to the senior management were wrong uh we just realized it the person in it who was backing up the information uh was also scrutinized highly by the senior management because they did not want one person to negate the high bonuses that they were going to receive it was a tough situation because nobody wanted the negative information to flow around so the senior management tried to pressurize the it folks and uh to finalize on the higher number but it was a wrong thing to do uh we analyzed the situation and found out that it was correct so we had to communicate that to the senior management and take the hit and we did it
uh there was one situation one of my manager's manager was uh pretty old school he was a very very senior in a very senior position but he was a very old fashioned guy who loved using paper and did not like computers at all or tried to minimize the use of computers he printed every e-mail he printed every document he received so it was uh he did receive one long complicated spreadsheet once and it was difficult for him to find the right formula to work on how the spreadsheet was working uh so he approached me and he asked me hey you know you are a young person you must know you are good at excel so why don't you show me how to do it now the person who barely uses excel it's difficult for them to explain how excel works uh so initially what i did was i related excel to uh paper or stuff to what he was used to looking at which is plain sheets of paper so i showed him that how excel is like a plain sheet of paper with just a grid on it and each cell in the grid had the capability to use the formulas to do the maths functioning that calculator does and he was very good at calculators so i tried to relate everything that excel had that the that the new technology had relating it to the old technology so it was basically one excel spreadsheet did multiple things that old technology or the overall technologies did uh and he was able to understand it so just trying to relate what a person knows to what he doesn't know helps
in my experience here at ets uh i have extensive uh experience program coordinate role i was in test taker resolution services program coordinator roles is unique because you are not the former leader in the sense that you are the manager of a group you are directly responsible for all the inputs and outputs and processes associated with um large scale assessment and uh resolution activities that need to go into resolving those uh test scores um in most of the different groups there is a large amount of full time staff all reporting to a manager uh in this roles you need to assume a leadership role uh over people that don't actually directly report to you that may or may not uh see you as their direct supervisor or their direct um reporting line um some of the things that you'd have to do is um really be cognizant of how people feel what some of the things were that they did and really be aware of the situation that you are in and really be respectful and responsive to how um different people react in different situations you have to take a large quantity of staff really be on top of what the different subject matter was how you need to communicate that to staff keeping all the different management lines in constant communication so that the message you were portraying to staff was a very similar message to the manager as well as the director all the other upper level management so that there is a seamless transition to the information that you are providing to your team um that they would also receive from their management um i feel that over the past uh years that i have served that role that uh we had some great successes and i'll say we have really mastered um that ability to civilly show that without having any formal um recognition of it
working in the resolutions department we come across a variety of different issues and and errors that come about through the various different testing streams that we accommodate and help support when these errors occur uh it creates a uh large amount of additional work it creates manual intervention quality control other sorts of actions that you need to take to remediate the situation and uh successfully deliver a finished product or scores or whatever you are looking to accomplish uh most of the time um when we have these issues we need to rally a large quantity of staff to perform sometimes road exercises in terms of quality control or updating of certain records or demographic information when you get that large group together you really need to have a goal in mind and it's clear thought process of how you're going to tackle these large scale projects because often times you are under a strict time constrain motivating staff is really important in this because you have to make sure everyone is continually moving forward with the project and constantly keeps their eye on short term goals to accumulate successes to get this uh overarching project this issue wrapped up and resolved um a lot of the things that we do to make sure staff gets motivated might seem quite simple but um really goes a long way to making sure everyone feels valued and understands the importance of this uh we do our absolute best to make sure people totally understand the plan and the course of action so that they feel involved in the thought process and the execution of it we make sure that if the situation warrants that we uh purchase food for people uh provide lunch provide dinner if it's working late at night uh when we end large scale projects we have to give small awards and other things so we build this cheered motivation uh through out the whole project to make sure everyone is moving at the same pace forward
in a lot of my course work i did a writer at night um it was a very interesting environment we had a large quantity of uh students from varying different backgrounds whether they'd be full time students or were just taking night classes whether they'd be uh students that were fully employed working at night um continuing education students um you know people coming back to school after large uh absences and often associated with these courses especially in the business and management courses i was taking uh a large quantity of those had group projects associated with them so these group projects where we take all these different people from all these different backgrounds and we put them together there was often times a lot of conflict you had people that had various different work ethics various different understanding of a subject matter uh different levels of commitment to the project um and it created a lot of attention and i've had multiple situations where we had multiple team members who did not get along for that particular project one of the things i always look at when you get in those situations is really focus on what it is we are actually doing in the project what are the tasks associated  with that person what are things that they are responsible for and what is really necessary for these team members to produce to create a successful project? you really have to break yourself away from the personal issues of it you can never know why someone may not be agreeing with you why someone may not be as committed why maybe someone has some drastically different view point when you are in these project situations and these groups you really need to focus on what that project is and the understanding of people's different life situations and come up with a clear cut plan of what exactly each person needs to put together and uh add into the project so that they can complete it as a group and uh make a successful project out of it
i've been a member of uh the test taker resolution services for about seven or eight years now and over the course of that tenure we've had a lot of different changes that have taken place that we've had to communicate to staff a variety of different levels where this comes into the negotiation part is that often times when changes occur especially organization changes shifting responsibilities or programs it's very similar to a negotiation when you meet a variety of different staff about it because you are trying to negotiate with them to have them buy into this new idea and a key component of whether or not they're going to buy into this is whether or not they trust you the trust part is i think the most critical part in negotiation in general but especially when it comes to things like changes trust is something that you have to they had to build over time um and it's something you have to work on and show results show clear cut results uh based upon actions promises uh conversations that you have and it doesn't necessarily have to be a long amount of time depending on what the type of negotiation is we are talking about making organizational changes or trying to communicate things to staff that level of trust has built over a longer period of time so that when we go and we communicate these things you are going to leverage that trust that you build up to get people to negotiate with them to buy into the fact that these changes that we are making is either good for everyone or good for these people or good for these program for other items uh smaller term negotiations it may just be as simple as uh you follow it up on the email that you said you were going to so that when you call your prospective client back and you start negotiating with them more they trust that at least in the first instance you followed up and you said you did what you said you were going to do um so that might be sufficient enough trust
anytime you want to ask me a question about bargaining or compromising one thing i always think about is when uh you go and you purchase a car uh about a year and a half ago two years ago in two thousand twelve i went and i purchased a new car so i go into the lot and i find a car and i like this car and this is the car i want i looked at a few other cars and i said no this one car this one dealership this is the car i want so i'm now in the situation where i have someone else to sell me a car i have a car i want to buy the car is in the lot and i have the money so we sit down and they start giving you all these information about all sorts of things how they come up with their price what are all these services what are these packages how does this package link to this other package why you need this service or this add on um i remember sitting there for a good hour listening to all this and you're trying to scramble and you are asking all these questions but really what came down to is what do i want to pay? right i kind of took a step back and said okay what do i want out of this? what is the most important thing to me? and i said okay i want the cheapest price possible well and what's the most important thing for mumble across the way for me right which is to make a profit not only his company but himself? so i kind of realized in that situation okay at some level he needs to make money and at some level i need a good price so once i decided what i want in terms of the price and said this is what i feel comfortable paying what can you do to make that happen? he was about to construct a deal that will end up enough with my goals where i got out of it what i wanted and i was happy with what i was paying regardless of any of the other factors i was okay with it and he got out of it what he needed which was he structured a deal that was going to make him look good or whatever his other goals are
this is a topic i feel really comfortable talking about uh in my tenure we've had a lot of different um issues or requests for changes and anytime that happens a major component in the request for change involves processes designed and system architecture and making changes to certain things often certain times when you get in these situations you have different groups within your organization that have different ideas about how they should proceed with the change part of my role through out my career has been to develop these changes reviewing them with different groups and getting them to buy in with this is the proposal that we need to go with there is a few ways that uh i feel that i do extremely extremely well at to make that happen one i'm a firm believer that you really need to understand the subject matter of what you're talking about why you're making these changes and what exactly is your change going to do to fix um that problem every proposal out there is basically to change or fix an existing problem or do something better so if you really understand the subject matter and you really understand exactly what your change is going to do then the next step really is to clearly communicate that to an appropriate audience being able to change your message whether it be to lowest level of technology people or high level executives um and then be ready and prepared to defend and respond to questions and inquiries uh about your particular proposal or change or contractor whatever the situation is but i think it all really goes back to subject matter really being the subject matter expert and kind of going back to what we talked about before if you can build trust through subject matter expertise people are going to be more likely to buy into your proposal and ideas
i think you're going to have a lot of situations occur where you are going to have to work with people that you don't get along with and dealing with that is a huge component to success i believe a major contributor to how successful you're going to be is what is the variety of people that you can work with because if you can work with a variety of people then you can leverage a variety of skills knowledge based expertise to uh loop into project or assessment based work and produce the best results possible when you come across people that don't aren't traditionally people that others enjoy working for i think the key is to differentiate those individuals that really have a firm grasp of the knowledge and or has a firm a large amount of expertise and really determining out of these individuals that who i don't particularly enjoy working with what are the things that i know i can rely on them to do?  what are the things that i can respect them and acknowledge in them that they do well and what can i focus on to make the relationship as positive as possible? even if they're items that i don't particularly care for um maybe there is other parts of these people that i can really um leverage and really use and try to focus on that and really just keep everything on a forward looking um progression so that you're constantly looking towards the next goal and you're not overly criticizing people for previous mistakes or previous issues
i don't think i have a personal situation where i was involved in something like this so instead let me tell you the advise that i would give to an employee of mine or a prospective ah friend or colleague who is looking for a job or was in a new role so if you are in a situation that you feel that you are for anything maybe it's not even unpleasant task that you are getting more work or more responsibility or more um tedious or demanding work than other employees my advice to people is always to keep an open line of communication with your direct management a lot of times people can get myopic in their focus and often times they are not in the position to truly understand why um certain decisions are being made so it's very possible that there is a really good reason why you might have a different set of task than other people and it might actually be a good thing that you are getting more of the unpleasant task than another person if these tedious boring tasks involve a lot of subject matter and quality control it might be because your manager or your supervisors really value this work that you are doing and you are able to show this great results um i think that if you keep the line of communication open and when you talk about it if you talk about it in a positive way and in a way that says i just want open communication about this i'm here as a team player and always position yourself as a team player i think that you'll gain the acknowledgment that you want that you'll really get a good understanding and it'll help move your career forward because your manager will see how you are able to communicate in a professional manner
again i don't believe i have a personal story to share about this particular situation so i'll speak about this in a broader sense and some of my view points on this sort of situation uh i firmly believe that leaders especially uh those that are placed in the leadership of a group do have some leeway to make changes and often times they need to make changes with that being said there is always a give and take in terms of of how drastic the change need to be and what input the leader gets from those uh contributions i think from the view point of someone who is part of this group and has made contributions when the leadership changes and a change of direction is made i think that it's an opportunity to really make some critical self reflection and say is this really the right direction for the group? does this change or the uh dropping of certain contributions uh does this actually make more sense? is the new opinion or the new direction better than the previous direction or is it just different? and you know if it's different can you still be a part of that can you still buy into that your job is to be a team player your job is to uh be part of this project to show results to solve the problem or issues or service the client that your company has put you in uh and uh part of the job is to work with the leadership in accordance with that you know as long the direction and the vision that you're moving forward accomplishes some of those goals even though some contributions were dropped i think that if you look hard enough you can find ways to buy into this projects at a larger scale
in test taker services we use a large amount of agency staff due to the peaks and valleys of our processes and cycles and the programs that we support with this influx of new staff uhwe have to be very adapt to training staff bring them on board teaching them subject matter knowledge that they need to do communicating with them and telling them exactly what the tasks are that we need to accomplish through that exchange often times we have communication issues and minor communication problems and me personally as a manager in test taker services i often have to rely on my listening skills to really take a moment and hear the issues or the complaints that people are bringing to me to really dissect and figure out what is the root nature of the problem because often times the proceed problem even from the staff that may be bringing to you is very different than the actual problem at its core in a situation a few weeks ago that agency staff really upset and as i was listening to him describe the situation and describe what was happening i really started to realize that the root issue wasn't about the another staff's attitude or what was being said to them it was really about how they felt that another agency staff at their level was taking a leadership role that they felt that shouldn't be taken which is very different than the message they were communicating so really listening and analyzing and hearing out what people are saying to you that's how you can break down these communication problems that's how you're going to really get to the root causes of some of these issues and potentially you can really spear head and head some things off that would otherwise go to bigger issues
in resolutions we have a large amount of manual processes and a lot of these manual processes affects scores we produce scores quality control scores then make updates to the records anytime we have these manual processes not often but there comes instances where errors that come out of these manual processes and incorrect scores get produced this creates a very uh tense situation especially when myself as a manager reading from my previous experience as a program coordinator would get all the information about an error and then would have to go and communicate that not only to my direct supervisor but also top level management and it can be very stressful and it can be very uh sensitive one of the the things i feel that is really important when delivering this type of issue is really understanding the scope of the issue and really understanding what needs to happen to contain the issue anytime that there is an issue that arises you have to communicate this type of information you need to be able to assure people that you fully understand how big the issue is and what exactly are the steps that you're going to have to contain it once you can do that that's when you can add in the subject matter and the knowledge base that you have and leverage that to really start building trust with these individuals to try to get them to buy into the fact that you have a firm understanding of the the situation you know every step you need to take to resolve the situation and they can feel comfortable with allowing you to take those steps necessary to resolve the situation then if you find out through out the process there are items that you need or there are things that you need help with when you go and request for aid people will be much more forthcoming with that
one of the skills i feel that i have learned in my career at ets is the ability to communicate the same message to a variety of different audiences and a variety of different skill level in my current role i speak to agency staff that have months worth of experience with us i speak with entry level ets regular staff i speak with midtear ets staff i speak with ets upper management i communicate with vendors a variety of different audiences with a vastly different realm of technical expertise and knowledge specially to our process uh when i come across these situations where i need to explain these technical or complex items to audiences i feel that may or may not be as technical i try to break things down to the process level explain things in a work flow that moves from step to step to step or process to process to process so that people can visualize exactly what i'm talking about another strategy i use is often times when i speak and i'm explaining subjects i'll pause and ask if what i'm saying makes sense you know if i explain that we need to do this to a record and then we're going to produce a score report does that make sense? is what i'm saying connect the dots? so that you don't get to the end of an explanation and realize your audience was really lost you are much higher up stream take different points of the conversation stop and pause and make sure that you verbally ask for acknowledgment that what you're saying is making sense on that they are fully understanding what you're trying to communicate to them i feel that's really affective in getting non-technical staff familiar and understanding of some more complex ideas
uh when i first began my teaching career uh i was at an independent school in new york city and um i had entered into a foreign language department that was um i would say quite antiquated in some ways and we needed to um take a look at the curriculum that we were using and potentially look at new text book uh adoption so although i was a new teacher i had gone through many teacher training classes i had decided to uh sort of take the lead on reviewing text books contacting the publishers and doing a formal review of the text books that were currently in um the field at that time uh that was very much when uh we were going into a lot of using authentic materials in uh foreign language teaching um i did a thorough review of approximately five different um text books from different editors and uh at that point i had come to i had to design a rubric that i used for the evaluation um i then made a presentation um to my committee and to my colleagues uh because you wanted to use it primarily for french which was my field but the department chair also felt it was important that if we were going to make a change that we could make the change across the board for all the romance languages at that point which would have been french german spanish and italian so i made a form presentation to them i presented the uh my selected choice that i thought fit the criteria that we were looking for for the department and then the committee at that point uh decided to make a decision and um i was pleasantly surprised that they did agree and we did adopt this new formal um text book to be used for teaching
uh during my career i spent uh several years as a head of an upper school in an independent school system and um at that time we always had parent teacher conferences and these were the typical sort of led by the uh advisor of the student and the parents would come in the student would be there and it ended up being very much where the parent and the uh teacher were having much more of the discussion and the student played a very uh background uh situation teachers at one point really were losing interest in this advisory system but i felt that as the leader of the division it was very important for us to have a program that was functional that worked and that um actually focused on the student so what i had done was at that point i decided let's switch the roles of how we would have these advisory meetings and we made them more student led so that the student would be the one that would carry on the conversation um and prior to those meetings there would be um specific tasks that each student would have to do in order to prepare they needed to set personal goals academic goals they needed to take a look at what they were hoping to accomplish for the year uh what they envisioned might be some of their pitfalls or some of their strengths so that when we had the meeting uh which happened actually twice a year um it then became student led so that the student was the one who was talking directly to the parent and he teacher then really became more of an advisor so that they would interject from time to time add some information but really it was a student having a strong discussion with the parents which was rather new since um that was not happening in the past and it gave the families some good information
uh during my career in education i was on several self studies of uh schools and in one particular case i was at a uh school that was in uh the state of arkansas and it was an independent school that was military based there were three of us on this committee and we were looking at the governance section of the school and a portion of that also dealt with the student discipline um it was interesting in the fact that at this time and this was uh still dealing i would say in the nineteen nineties that there was corporal punishment being used at this institution uh and there was very much carry over from the uh military side of the institution uh my other two colleagues had a very difficult time dealing with this and they had um we spent many time in not really accomplish much but more sort of in heavy duty discussion and so i thought one of the steps that we could take in order to complete the task of doing the review was uh i had looked at what we needed to cover i broke it down into three distinct areas so that each one of us would be in charge of or responsible for one portion of the self study that we were doing so that when we came back at the end we then could share what we had discovered on our own private interviews our own research and then get together and to write up the section that we needed to prepare for the self study um this way the other two members although they did not work well together on one project but when they each had their individual piece and then was able to work as a group and we all had to formulate the uh project and putting together on paper uh the recommendations that worked out quite well
on one occasion as being a school leader um i had to deal with a situation that was quite challenging especially since it dealt with two veteran teachers and these two individuals had been at the school for um many years and certainly much longer than i had been there but i came in as the leader and i needed to be able to work with everyone and of course as the um division head trust was extremely important so um in this situation we were dealing with the two that i they had a difficult time um working together and they shared for example um the eighth grade the eight grade was divided into two sections shall we just call it section a and section b and they were both um in charge of each group uh one per group rather excuse me um but they really had many clashes along the way on general decisions that had to be made in reference to the class so what i tried to do was one we would have we had several meetings along the way where i had to bring them in together um i wanted to make sure that they did trust me so i wanted to listen to them first make sure that they had an understanding that i was under hearing them and trying to get to get to the trying to understand where they were coming from but then i had to sort of negotiate and work with them and remind them at various times along these conversations where i've just said we had had several that they um had to kind of pull away from their personal bias and their personal um choices and realize that our focus was the student we're the students in the classes and what they were doing so that hopefully they could then see past what their personal issues were and regain focus at looking at what was best for the student
uh one of the most surprising times for me in schools came when we had to uh at the end of the year as a faculty get together and select award winners uh this is where you would see in many cases there were a lot of personal teacher bias for certain students over other students and what i did was in order to try make this a fair sort of situation i had drawn up uh a list of criterion that i wanted to use during these discussions so that we would be able to look at each student individually and see if they were meritorious of any sort of the awards that we had to distribute for our commencement exercises uh this at first became uh was not well accepted they felt that i was coming in sort of very strong very demanding and i wasn't giving them the opportunity to voice their own opinion so what we did was and i thought in reality this worked out very well was  that i took the list that i had drawn up i broke them down into different groups so we had four or five different groups working on this list they did revisions uh they added subtracted they put in uh things that they wanted to do uh or qualities and expectations that they thought would be important they brought that back to the group and then as a whole we were able to come up with a new document that we could use that everyone felt comfortable with in choosing uh award winners for the various prizes that we had to offer at commencement uh i'm very glad that i backed down and allowed them to do that because what would their buy in this was something that we had established my first year at the school and for my time period there it had worked very well
um as a college counselor in an independent school um our job the job is very difficult in the respect that we need to be able to work with the families and with the students as a partner and um in this one presence in the school that i was in there were two of us who were working on college counseling and we were working with uh different groups of students um the other individual had been doing this for quite some time and had her own system to work with um and when i reviewed it and when i looked at it um i had encountered and i felt some strong differences of opinions and so what we needed to do was to sit down and to talk about it and to really take a look at why she was doing what she was doing? what was the the expected result? and was she reaching that result or reaching that goal um and so what we ended up doing was after several meetings um i of course during that time was presenting my cases and how i wanted the system to change because for her it was becoming more that she was the central figure in all of this when in actuality it was more the family and the student who should have been the real focus and so we um devised documentation and a calendar that allowed us then to work together very collegiately uh we had one joint meeting with the parents in the very beginning both of us even though it wasn't my student or it may not have been her student but the parents had heard from both of us and then we broke out and we worked with different individual students and this was something that in the end she really enjoyed because we started out together we shared a common interest among the student and family and then were able to work
um i moved back to the north east about uh four or five years ago and in doing that ended up having to make a career change and so uh while i was dealing with at that point um a lot of different issues especially coming to uh a situation where i had been a leader or in management in school organizations then coming into another organization where i was um sort of the employee i did not have any sort of shall we say ranking as um a manager and um i had one colleague with which with whom i was working and um it was a very difficult situation all the way round uh this person was very strong headed uh very intimidating and at first i let that uh take me i kind of fell under that um because i was beginning to feel very insecure in my abilities on what i was doing and so whatever this person had said is something that i had believed um it really was uh a learning experience for me even at a later age where i had had so much work experience before it just taught me that there's always you're always in a learning process um our interactions were um mostly professional there were times that there was gossip being spread um and blame was being placed and therefore became more of a he said she said situation so it ended up not being the most pleasant of work environment for either one of us um but we were able to accomplish the work that we needed to get done we ended up completing everything that as i said that needed to be finished um but yet there is still tension that exists
uh moving into this new work environment um brought about many different changes in the type of work that i was doing and so um going as i say from a managerial role down to the employee role and working on just specific tasks there were times i found it that i was just doing the same thing over and over and over and over um but also had been given more on my plate than other colleagues and um it certainly was something that sort of weighed heavy on me and i was not um at this point sure really what to do so um what i would have thought i would have expected from my employees what they would come and speak with me as the director manager so that's exactly what i did at this point in time i felt that i was putting in a lot of work um i was doing the same kind of tasks i was working on weekend and i know that others were not i had many more different um program titles on my plate than others so i went to my manager to discus the situation and just to kind of ask questions about why this was happening why i was given this specific task? why was i being stretched further than others? um was it because i came in at a different level than some other new hires? um so it was usually very interesting to me that um something like this was happening and so i then as i said spoke with the manager and um through our discussions i accepted what was given as an answer um i cannot say that i fully agreed with it but it was a new situation it was a new working environment i was still learning the climate of what the um working environment was calling for so it was not um i would say resolved the way i wanted but i did listen to the manager and i accepted
um for the situation here one of a colleague was given the role to uh be the leader of a group project that we were working on and there were about four of us that were part of the group and all of us had the content knowledge that was required for this project the leader basically just walked in took control and for the three of us did not pay much attention to what we were saying um and actually did ignore what our suggestions were so uh it got to a point where most of the meeting that we had were fruitless i mean there was no reason to go we weren't really getting anything done that we wanted or we felt was important and um i just did not think that this person was the right person for the position so i tried to speak with the person individually and see where they were coming from to try to understand why they were doing or managing the group the way they were managing it uh because i thought there could have been some other skills used that would have been more profitable and more encouraging and motivating to the others the person did not really pay much attention uh face to face it was fine but when we got back into the group setting the person fell back into the same old routine uh i then uh went to speak to the managers about this uh felt that they also did not do much uh to help uh resolve the issue and then moved up to the senior director kind of following the protocol that's necessary uh it was an important project but it was usually only the voice of one person and if the three others if we were going to be putting our names to this uh there needed to be a time where we would be heard and our contributions would have been accepted so the uh senior director did step in and there was a replacement for the leader
uh coming to consensus on a uh decision is extremely difficult at times um in particularly dealing with uh certain people or uh with a dynamic of the group um and in this one particular case we were trying to come up with um ideas on how to uh revise specific um materials that we wanted to be using in uh some of our test development so the uh i found that after we met as a group we had discussed um and voiced our opinions um one of the best ways for us to overcome this idea of everyone not really communicating well that people really weren't listening that it was best to um kind of take a little bit of a lead and just give each person the amount quiet time specific time so that we all could listen to each other rather than talk over each other i think that uh my personal opinion is that some people have a very difficult time listening they'd rather just go in take the lead move forward uh but not actually listen to others and by sitting back and by listening i think there's a great way that you are able to um gain more understanding of what is uh someone else of course is thinking what their ideas might be um and so in this case uh after we were able to separate our selves listen to what each one had to say work together then discuss as a group we were able then to come up with materials that we felt were certainly test worthy of high quality and um very useful for the product
in working on the projects that i have presently right now uh one in particular has specific test specs that we have to follow with a very strong blueprint and uh this is a current situation that we're going through where uh we're asked to be aligned that there are several content uh areas that are asked to be aligned across our curriculum and our exam and uh one of my colleagues in the one of the other content areas uh is not particularly following the blueprint the way that it should be done and that is causing some very difficulty issues among interior among the other colleagues and myself as well as we need to be careful then how this is communicated to the client uh and so this has been going on and my colleagues who's not following the blueprint is working with a second colleague the second colleague is trying to uh get her colleague back on focus and their communication and his treatment of her has not been the uh most professional and at times to be very honest it is sort of uh rather negative and uh i felt that this was something i had a hard time seeing and a hard time watching i had encouraged the female colleague to go ahead and speak with managers to share how she was feeling and what was going on uh but it was still something that was gnawing at me as i made an appointment to speak with the managers myself as i was there uh observing all of this and seeing how this was happening and seeing what was going on so although it was very difficult i thought it was important to go face to face
uh i work on a program in ap advanced placement and in our first face to face committee meeting uh in the fall following the exams in may we have to give the committee uh a review of the statistics of how each section of the exam performed um and this is something that is extremely challenging because uh understanding test specs and test stats uh is not easy what we have decided and my colleague and i when we looked at this and um our decision was the best way probably to present the material so that the test development committee would understand its relevance and its importance was to work through graphs and charts was to take the numbers and instead of just presenting list of numbers and talking about uh what each one means it was to show it graphically that way then they were really able to see for example um what the mean score was where did it fall on this graph? uh what were some of the easier questions what were some of the harder questions what test type was more difficult than others um i think using the as i said sort of the pictures the graphs the charts it made the information uh much more um acceptable and understandable to them so that when we start working on developing future exams and future items and future uh questions we can then go back review what we have seen and then start making decisions on how do we change specific things to make them more difficult or more easy or which task type needs to be amped a little bit up or needs to be lowered so uh taking statistics and putting them into graphs and pictures uh certainly made our committee understand more what it was about
about a couple of years ago i had a situation where i had to uh take a lead charge of the project um even though i wasn't lead of the project due to my uh managers um busy schedule so he told me um zurisha you have to take this task and uh um talk to the other people other groups in the within the it and get it get work done i was uh very nervous at that time because uh for me it's going out and you know just i was a programmer i'm a programmer so just sit at the desk and code is my job and talking to the other groups was um not kind of my thing so anyway uh i set up uh meetings with other groups and i introduced myself and i told them that i will be leading from our group and uh um i'll be taking uh any help from them until we accomplish the tasks that needs to be done for the projects so i was a bit uh nervous to reaching out everyone and getting their help in the beginning but once uh it also once you get them and once we put all the requirements together uh other people in the other groups can also be able to um provide the questions and answers whenever i had questions or anything so i'm able to carry the task of course it was a bit rough in the beginning some people were not that cooperative but once they started realizing how important this is um they are able to be cooperating and uh i was able to finish the task with uh no issues and it was a success at that time
well uh we have a co-worker um that uh feels like that uh person has to do only when she's told to what to do but not uh motivated herself uh but uh as been uh an uh it programmer it's not like you cannot just say i only do what i've been told to do it's you have to you have to take ownership of the work that you are given it's not like uh just as a uh manager and a programmer relation it's not just that you have to make sure that you are being take the ownership of all the task that you have to do if you are not able to if you even know there is something that's not provided or accurate uh not accurate for your task you have to reach out to the group or the people that needs to be uh able to help you out or need to provide answers for that um i tried a couple of times that uh if that person works in a way that i'm trying to help reaching out to people you know if she has issues that would actually give her in a good put her in a good place in the work situation and stuff just being herself and not being not taking any kind of ownership um actually i wasn't that much of successful in that it's just i uh she feels like that we are trying to put her down but that's not true we are trying to uh help her at least i tried my best to help her to uh come up the right way um to help her it's not just the task or the job at that time it would help her career also i tried to put it that way and uh that's how i try to motivate her i don't know how much it helped her but that's what i did
well let's say pretty interesting question um yes i do have that situation um i mean i'm sorry to say i have to admit it it didn't happen just once it happened more than once actually so one of the situation um we had two programmers um right now in the project i'm the lead um developer so we have people that in the group we work as a group but um a couple of people we haven't um they are very good programmers they are good people it's just um one of the programmers somehow felt that the uh other programmers work is more important than his and um he didn't say anything to me about that um we just whenever we are assigned task we think you know depending on the time on the the programmers work in other projects we cancel all of that it's just not there everyday or what they cannot or can do it's also a um thing that we take in a account but that's not the only um item that we look at but so this person felt veryum insecure and think that his work is not important the other person's work is and that's it he stopped cooperating with other programmers stopped talking to him and um uh kind of giving him a cold shoulder or it's i noticed that in a meeting and then one day i got an email saying that from the other programmers saying do you know why this programmer is behaving that way and all because i do not know so i called the other programmer and he said well i don't have anything but um i do feel that you are not being good to me or you didn't give me the important task and other person is taking over me and i felt that way so i tried to work it out saying that both of them are good and he um cannot be in a work situation workplace that um without cooperating with one another in the project he won't be able to be successful not just by themselves but for the project's sake also uh it has to be they had to work together
well uh last year we did a project to one of the programs here at ets and that is already actually providing score reports uh the director of that uh program uh was not being trust our group actually uh she wasn't she doesn't i felt like she wants the project but somehow she felt like we are not capable of doing the project and we once we understand that and once i realized this is what's going on and she is kind of not being negative in the meetings um i tried to reach out to her by phone and e-mail and one time i spent i got five minutes of time with her and i sat down with her and i said this is not something that is for us actually this is something that we are building for them and it says once we built for them how much of the the programs importance and how good it is for the program i tried to picture that to her and soon we started developing and i uh used to give her demos of the project progress and i remember she saying after our first demo uh it has how the score reports uh gets reported and uh how everything now can be automated and how users can be happy and i asked her to share the screens with the users and once she did that and how the users responses she actually was honest to me and said i can't be thankful enough to your manager for providing me such a solution and so for uh but she didn't apologize or anything that's fine she said she understood how important this project uh could be for her and how much it will be lift of their groups pride in uh ets so uh it was hard in the beginning but it kind of worked out i think this way in this situation my director also helped me how to approach this person uh and get things done
well um there are a lot of times in the workplace in the work projects that we are working on that we have to um compromise um a lot of situations at work the releases and what needs to be done what needs not to be done or what we'll be able to by but the deadline or what we will not be able to do by the deadline that's how it is um in negotiation and um working with um different groups to make sure that things would come out what we wished for but that that won't be the case all the times sometimes we are successful and sometimes we are not um well recently we were supposed to do a full release for one of the projects but um given the time line and everything we had to make sure which one takes the priority one or the important ones that we can do and um we reached out to the group that we are working for and we laid out the plan to them okay we had um put them as three different buckets which is the most appropriate and most important one that needs to go out within the time frame and which can wait for a bit longer or try to squeeze in within this one or some of the things that we can push out till the next release um it wasn't easy with the group but um they understand the situation too so they try to push in some more things within the same release i know that would make our team work more hours um more time to spend on the project but uh um we are in a uh programming side it side so in this situation usually pro we had to listen to our users we need to take their um we had most of the time we needed we end up doing what they requested for us um so that's what we do um we try to do which they have come up with um within the situation and provided by for this release and some push it next release
uh earlier the situation this kind of i didn't come across many of them but uh recently we were uh moving between two different technologies that we need to use in our upcoming project uh i tried it since we are actually with the current project we are working on we took a new technology initiative and within that project we have another sub project and uh i kind of i said that we need to take the sub project also needs to be in the new technology and stop being going back to the old one because anyway we are in a new why not take everything in new in this uh project uh one of my teammate he's uh like no why can't we just use the old technology so that we don't have to uh hit too many huddles with the existing one and the upcoming one i was like well we are in the cold water already let's go deeper and uh  let's deal with it right now and stuff later so uh so we decided to go with and they agreed now my manager said i think that's that's the way we should do it and right now we are already in deep water so let's just go with the new technology and if any huddles come uh we'll deal with it so uh that's why uh we decided to go with the new technology i think i don't do much persuasion or i don't be very pushy in our projects like uh when it comes uh and they ask for my uh opinions i do lay it out but i really don't push it hard uh i let listen everybody and what they have to say and make the decision so in this situation uh the rest of the group also kind of agreed to go with the new technology and uh we decided to go with the new service technology for this project
well in many situations every time you work in a project of the group you don't have to it's not necessary that you had to like every person that comes in the group and it's the same thing they don't have to like me or but i try my best you know to do work together with other person in the project so because ultimately it's the project's success uh our failure depends on us so yes it does make sense to get along with the person that we work with uh so i do have a couple situations that i had been like this uh recently we started work we always work with this group there we have very good relationship with this group and uh they always accomplish uh provide what we need and we always say well they provide assistance for our projects so but in this group we had a new person they had a new person and that person was assigned to one of the projects that i'm working with it's not the person is bad it's just the person has a different uh personality she would be more visible in the e-mails and everything but when it comes to the work it's it's not uh productive that's how that's why we feel like it uh there was a big tension going on and it was continuing that way so uh i suggested that she wants to go out for lunch or anything she agreed at the same time i was nervous to go out to lunch myself with her so i invited another friend and we had some friendly conversation at lunch and uh i understand things were very good but it's okay i tried to keep everything in the e-mail and uh tried to specific relating to work you know this is what we need and uh whether she can focus on this and provide this for us uh it's working it's going on uh i won't say the way i want to work with her in future projects i would say no but at least we are in this now so we had to make it work
well my job is not anything of physical demand physically demanding it's just uh spending more time on a task mostly uh it's the one thing one thing i do not like is attending these boring meetings uh some of the meetings can be just sit there and go around on the same issue go around and around and around it's like never ending they just don't want to break it they want to reach to a point that everybody agrees upon whether do i  feel like uh that i'm doing more than the other teammates? i don't know i mean well uh we have two other leads and we are three leads in our group right now uh i do when we all have our own different projects but uh i feel like i do go some of the meetings more often than they had to because uh it depends on the work situation or the project that we are working on that's how it's going uh but uh tedious i don't think my i can't i can say sometimes it can get tedious but i don't mind if it's the tedious relating to coding i won't mind doing it at all but uh if it is tedious that i need to make sure other people are working and i try to do my you know try to do it help them out to get the things help them out to get to reach a point that they can do it themselves but i nicely say i cannot do this help them out all the time that way but uh i think it's going okay for now i wouldn't say it's too boring or uh tedious
well i wish they do that they give leadership of a project to one of the person and they just make me work for the project i wish they do that because um it's been it's been a lot of work recently so not just recently it's been past two three years and like that um and this year is the craziest year so i wouldn't mind to work under a person's leadership at this time so uh i'm okay with it and to me honestly why not? if the person is leading a project and we are all in the same project uh we should work it in a way to make the project be a success that's how that's the way that i see it so um yeah i won't mind
um i attend a lot of conference calls and sometimes they are very boring and i don't pay much attention sometimes and i might miss a key point and unless they call out my project name or my name i ask them to repeat the question and provide the response that i can um i do not have a situation where i missed a really important key point while in a meeting and uh that affected the project i'm not in that situation so far hopefully i would not get in that kind of a situationum
uh difficult information or critical feedback well the difficult information that i had to deal with uh would be a application crushing production or the application that don't crush and that kind of information uh usually critical feedback is if i felt if the users are being give us a negative feedback or and they do e-mails that kind of things always so uh actually i feel so bad to take it it's just my manager is the one that says it's okay it's part of the job uh the situation is when we had the uh one of the score reporting sites went up uh the scores that were given in there uh were taking much longer to download and users are really really upset about it so uh he told us how we talked how else we can make it uh faster but uh taking that as a programmer taking that to my uh manager was not easy for me because you don't want to say you messed up in a code anyway so or your programmers messed up but i really don't want to blame it on our programmers so as a lead i failed uh and i would have been you know more visual uh or more vigilant of what the programmers are doing in the coding so that's what happened uh we corrected it we had to do it another release but uh that wasn't easy and i tried my best not to do it again and i'm trying it's been so far good
actually i think i'm getting better at it um in this kind of situations i used to be explaining to our users in technical coding terms and not understanding their blank faces but soon i learned that uh that's not the way i should i shouldn't explain to them just like how i explained to the other person so um when it comes to if there is an issue or how we need to implement a solution it's better i realized it's better to explain it to them in a real life scenario uh than explaining on to them how complex it is in the on technology side so uh i don't recall right now there is some specific examples but that's the way i realized i should be doing and that's the way that's the way i'm going right now
i think that one of the most current examples that i could use for this is when i was working on the texes theater exam as the lead admin i was charged with procurements which meant that i had to identify and recruit potential outside item writers for the texes theater exam to start with this i was working with two assessment specialists and after our initial meeting where they discussed what they were looking for neither of them had ever worked with improvement before and that is something that i specialize in so i was able to really take charge of that aspect of it when i started i looked at the search parameters that had come up during discussion and i found a website that specialized in uh texes educator theater awards and i thought it would also be more qualified to writing up theater event past awards with mumble with that i was able to get contact information and i launched them to a sales pitch pitch that i had previously run by the assessment specialists for approval and i recruited them thankfully i was able to recruit a number of outside item writers i want to see around thirty-five or so ten of which are working for that department now i was able to conceptualize what needed to be done and then implement it which i think shows admirable leadership skills
my senior year of course i had uh an amazing opportunity to work as an apartment assistant an apartment assistant is sort of like a assistant but on steroids instead of thirty heads we had ninty two or i had ninty two on my floor and a total of six hundred fifty in the building unfortunately my tenure as an apartment assistant coincided with hurricane sandy so in terms of building motivation the first thing that comes to my mind is when myself and a number of my fellow staff members were actually transported to the bush uh campus center where we slept on the floor for a number of days with a number of our residents these were residents that were mostly international or out of state students that had not been able to evacuate campus and find shelter nearby and it was particularly frustrating for some of my staff members and myself since we lived close by but due to our work we weren't allowed to go home because we have to be there to serve as a resource for the students so i decided to play games and i also this coincided right around halloween and i have a stockpile of candy and so i'd go around to my essentially when i saw that there is high or you know possibly starting to be a little bit cranky and i would shower them with candy since that would boost their sugar levels up and just remind them of why it is that we chose to do this which is more than the free housing an opportunity to serve as a resource to the students be there at their time of need of course we anticipated that this would be late night talks or just making sure that people don't get locked up in their rooms but it sort of became finding that crying student in the bathroom and reassuring them that their family would be all right or letting them know that if they needed help getting in contact after the storm was over there are various resources on campus to help them do so
during my time at mumble there was a group of classmates and friends and i decided to co-found a group called iu power we did so because we felt as if the labor studies students didn't really have the same avenue in terms of networking and resources and support that the human resource students had with the availability of sharing on campus iu power was supposed to pilot and it did pilot uh being a big presence for labor studies students to go out network and also work on the skills that we were building in the classroom since we were founding the club all of the members were incredibly passionate about the direction that the club should go in how to go about with the formation for anonymity sake i'm going to single out two members and call them zack and cody zack and cody were very passionate about the club but had very different ideas with the direction in which it should go and this difference caused them to clash multiple times the way that i ended up resolving that as the vice president of that club was to assign then to the same task and sort of forced them to work together and uh see if they could learn from each other and i decided to task them with recruitment we ended up having the biggest turn out for our events that we had all year because they are able to meet in common ground and use the two different approaches to work together to build a more successful events it was one of our most well attended and we actually had two board members serving on our it's still an existing club right now that started with coming to that event that zack and cody were in charge of
this makes me automatically think of a time that i spent interning at the equal employment opportunity commission i was actually given the opportunity to work as an assistant mediator in the new jersey field office in newark and my boss had a very interesting way of preparing us for this he would throw us into a situation and then come back and we would evaluate it but one of the most important things i learned during that time was how to build trust and how to get people to agree with you and uh sort of a very gentle way of guiding people to a resolution that you wanted this way was taught to me by my boss by using the seven yes rule so whenever i would call up a new charging party which is the employer well the employee that feels as if they had been discriminated against i would go over the background information that they had filled out and just confirm to them that what they had written was what had actually happened and i would just with them on everything or ask them to agree with me so i would ask is this your contact information yes you know just get them saying yes and building trust and then when they were opening up to me about what the situation was i was just the right active listener even on the phone when i couldn't give them my facial expressions i would murmur uh agreements and i would say yes you know i'm so proud of you for standing up for yourself or things of that nature to just let them know that i understood where they were coming from and they could trust me too then move forward with their case and move forward with their information in terms of how i presented it to the responding party and their lawyer
some of my previous co-workers may know i am known around the office as the excel queen but i wasn't always that way there was a time when i was very new to excel and i needed a lot of training but i had a lot of previous experience with outlook so what i did is i found a co-worker at one of my previous jobs who is excellent at excel and i bargained with her that i would do all of her calendering for her department because she got very frustrated with outlook if she would just spend half an hour each week teaching me excel so that was one of the ways that i taught myself about excel through that job experience with that relationship with a co-worker and i was able to sharpen up my outlook skills because when you're teaching someone you then become more proficient in what you're demonstrating to them it was a win win situation and i'm glad to say that that co-worker is now one of my close friends
when i first started working at ets i was tasked with mostly data entry and the software such as tcfs and what is now ibis have a one of my main duties today is data management and data management over a variety of spreadsheets that incorporate and encapsulate entirety of sat writing uh i track the data associated with test items from treatments to passage to unit development and form completion the way that i got that or i got tasked with that unfortunately is actually a very funny story there was a meeting that took place within the first few days of my hire uh at the time and uh during that meeting some assessment specialists where vocalizing their frustration of the current way that the data was being captured especially since each of them were capturing the data separately and there was sometimes miscommunication or just lack of communication in terms of where each item was in development and also they were using different tracking mechanism some of them kept track of it strictly via email others use excel others use static word documents and i had an idea at the start of the meeting of a way to synthesize that information and to make everyone's lives a lot easier but i chose not to speak at that moment what i did was after the meeting i went to each of the specialists individually and i asked them look at what data they had so far they were all very willing to give it to me and so what i did is i went and on my own created a mechanism to capture all of the data and record it and then also implement formulas conditional formatting and various linked cells to sort of alternate uh data entry and automate that capture and then at our next meeting i presented what i created and asked if they approved of it so that we could then start to use it moving forward
at a former job i was tasked with being in charge of this project and i was put on this project with a team of people including a co-worker who had a very different work style than i did and he and i had previously had uh discussions about these differences as the team leader i took responsibility of talking to him outside of the meeting outside of any our work with our other co-workers in addressing the fact that i would allow him to work the way that he thought was the most productive if he would be more open to constructive criticism in terms of the end results i like to let people work the way that they work best i feel as if one of the biggest hampers to productivity is to micro manage i also believe in learning from differences that people have because as my parents like to remind me there is more than one way to skin a cat and somebody always knows something that you don't know so at the end of the project i was very pleased with his approach i was very pleased with the way that we had worked all together he i guess was very happy that i had spoken to him that's why because he kept me in the loop the entire time every week i would get a status update as to where he was with the project and he ended up converting me into his way of doing things because that result was just fantastic and so i learned that open communication and trust is really what's necessary when you're working with someone that you do not necessarily get along with or you have a difference of opinion on in terms of how to get things done it's not about how it gets done it's the fact that it gets done and done well
if i were to rank what my favorite on the job activities were filing and data entry would not rank anywhere near the top ten however filing and data entry are some of the most important aspects of any job and so many of the jobs that i've been to coming in as the lowest trained member i have had to do my fair share of filing and data entry my approach to these is that if you're going to do anything you should do it well i truly believe in taking ownership of your work no matter what that work is and proving yourself through your abilities so every time that i have been assigned a task that i find distasteful i just see it as a challenge in terms of proving my abilities to my co-workers and my superiors in terms of if i have to file five hundred reports i am going to make sure that they are filed precisely and quickly if i have to enter twelve items or units i will make sure that they're entered as accurately as possible this is just one more way and one more challenge in terms of proving your worth to your co-workers and your company and so  i don't really i don't back down when i'm given tedious or boring or even physically demanding tasks because i feel as if if you understand you have a job there is no job that's too small and you just have to do what you have to do and do it well
at one of my previous jobs there was this project that i think about a lot i was put on a team with a couple of other co-workers and one of the workers was actually the lead on the project and we were charged with creating a deliverable to the client the lead decided that the project would be done in a certain way and presented in a format that i disagreed with and so in the interest of not causing disharmony within the group i didn't bring up my objections at a group level but i instead went to talk to him separately outside of the group i outlined exactly what my misgivings were and what i thought alternatives should be where he so inclined i will give him credit that he listened to me and he definitely made me feel heard but ultimately chose to go in the direction that he planned unfortunately the clients was not amenable to what we eventually presented to them and instead requested that it be in the format that i originally decided thankfully we were given the project again and this time we were able to present it in that format and maintain a relationship with that client what i learned from that is that it is important to voice your opinion but you have to remember that when you are not in a leadership position and when someone else is you have to respect their authority and not try and undermine them in any way if they have  chosen to do something a certain way and you are a member it is your duty to make sure that it is just done in the best way that you know how even if that way is not your vision
a few years ago i had an issue with a co-worker who i felt was just not really listening to any of the directives that i gave her or who there was just something wrong with the way that we were communicating with each other where i didn't sufficiently understood and i later learned that she just felt as if she wasn't being heard and the way that i resolved that is really just using active listening skills it wasn't enough for me to simply hear her i had  to show her that she had been heard and what that involved is when she told me something instead of having a response right away you know sort of being quiet and really taking my time to visibly absorb the information because when someone tells you something and you have a response right away it can give the impression that you may not have thought through what they said and sometimes that just five second lag where they can see visibly the process it  can mean a world of difference in terms of how they feel that you've resolved that information or received that information so that was sort of the things that i did another thing i did is again something that i learned at one of my previous job experiences which is mirroring so while she was talking to me and explaining what her frustrations with the project were i would say things like i see what you're saying or i agree with you i would also mirror her posture a little bit and if i felt she was getting exasperated i would let that show in my face like yes this is really a big problem and all of that worked together to really just make her feel as if her frustrations were being heard she was being taken seriously her contributions mattered and sometimes that's really all that needs to happen it's not enough to simply hear people you have to make sure that they feel heard
at one of my previous jobs where i was the executive assistant to the senior loss prevention manager she had gone on vacation for two weeks and tasked me with corresponding with different store managers in terms of security installations and other security uh related items one of the items and she told me that this was a really big priority to get done while she was gone was managing the files and also making sure that they were following procedures uh so that excessive uh police calls or um and sort of triggering a phone line wouldn't happen because the way that it works when you have a store in a city there is a city mumble and there is a fine every time you go over like five false police alarms a moth or a year i can't remember what the designation was and this store was exceeding that designation uh grossly and so it was my job to communicate with the store manager to sort of identify why and make sure that they were following our pre-established policy and procedures regarding the installation and activation of these alarms while she was out i did initiate conversation with them uh however they were very slow to get back to me and actually two days before she came back from vacation they had triggered another false alarm which then carried i think a fine of two hundred dollars which as the headquarters we have to pay out to them to then pay to the local uh governing body and that was the news that i have to communicate to my manager as soon as she got back from vacation and so the way that i did it is as soon as she came in i let her settle in we made small talk about how the vacation was and then at the top of my priority list in terms of letting her know events that occurred while she was gone that was the first thing that i addressed
as i previously mentioned and my resume reflects one of my areas of specialty is with excel and i find excel really intuitive i absolutely adore working with that program but not everyone does and as a member of toastmasters at least a couple of my speeches have dealt with excel and one of my speeches is actually highly technical in terms of explaining different excel formulas and use of conditional formatting for better data recording and the way that i approached this is to actually make very common uh similarities the way that i used the similarities was i compared excel and the formulas to a type of language and specifically the way that you sort of conjugate a sentence in the english language in terms of how you build innovate formula for example and by breaking it down to the smallest form and just showing okay so this is similar to this like this serves as a connector to that i was able or i hope that i was able to make the previously unfamiliar and highly technical material familiar and less technical to what was a very unfamiliar audience since that speech i've had numerous phone calls and emails requesting either help or thanking me for helping them understand the program just a little bit more and exposing them to what as now become highly useful and quick to learn skills in terms of data clean up and organization
so several months ago i knew that for this one major project that i have been assigned to we had to do a series of cog-webs leading up to a major client meeting that we had in may so it got to the point where we were informed that we had these upcoming duties probably back around january and between january and may we had to do two series of cog-webs and then analyze all the data and so we did the first series and then finished up all that work but then we had the second series to which we had maybe a month before the major client meeting to complete the second series of cog-webs so when i was in that situation i pretty much took it upon myself i was rather assertive in terms of preparing all the materials the irb all of the regulatory documents then in addition to that i stepped up and i was also very assertive even though i was not technically a leader i was still very assertive with making sure that our documents received approval as soon as possible and i took a proactive role which scheduling participants for conducting these cog-webs so in that situation i definitely assumed a leadership role even though i technically was not a formal leader and because of that we had a positive outcome we were able to reach our goal of conducting twenty cog-webs within that aggressive time-frame in addition to analyzing the data and having a final product that we could prepare for our big client meeting in may
so a colleague and i received notice that north eastern educational research association released its call for proposals and that we were able if we had any content that we were willing to work on and that we would be able to submit our proposals in order to be a part of that conference and in order to speak at that conference so this one colleague of mine he and i do a lot of work as lateral colleagues on the same major federal project but because this project has a lot of nda requirements he was not in a position where he was able to cement a proposal based on that project and i know one day he talked to me really upset or at least he looked really upset saying oh well i won't be able to attend here because i don't have any information i can work with that i can develop a proposal out of so i actually oriented him to a different project sent over some data to him ripped on the background of that project and helped guide him into reading a proposal to which he definitely went ahead accepted the challenge and he seemed really motivated to submit a final product to nearer our baseline content that he never had any exposure to luckily he was able to pull it off and he will be presenting at this upcoming conference so i think that definitely gave him some motivation to work on an extra project that otherwise he will not be in a position to execute
so i used to work at a psychiatric hospital and a lot of my colleagues didn't get along too well with my supervisor so i would always try to be the mediator i would understand what would make both my supervisors as well as my colleagues tick there were a lot of situations where i did not like being in the middle but i felt like i was placed in the middle but with that being said i tried to be an effective listener on both parties and i tried to do what i could to take away some strain from my supervisor as well as my former colleagues so if they were in a situation where they didn't feel comfortable discussing something with my former supervisor i would go ahead and actually help them re-word what they are trying to say to try to help them communicate more effectively their needs and the outcome of this was luckily things worked out for the most part i could definitely see that uh with these efforts it seemed like some of the tensions among my colleagues at the psych hospital seemed to temper off a little bit and because of that of course we all definitely worked more effectively
so my previous job this was a big part of my previous position i was an allied therapist at a psychiatric hospital and trying to gain the trust of my former clients was always an angling goal because if we cannot get any full disclosure of them then we cannot address any underlying issues that they are experiencing so in order to help them recover we had to try to develop a trusting rapport with them and in addition to that we also tried negotiating with them one big part of that of course in order to gain trust of my former clients i would always treat them in a very respectful manner and i would frequently try to go out of my way be very friendly to them but also in terms of negotiating i would always try be really transparent with them and sometimes they would make requests beyond me to which i would communicate assertively i don't know if i can actually do that but instead how about if i see if i could handle this for you instead because sometimes their request weren't always within the confines of my position but in that situation i would definitely be honest with them and i'd definitely tell them that i would try to help them get whatever they want or help them make whatever request that they are making but i would definitely in those situations i would never promise something that i would not be able to keep but i would let them know that i'll try i'll advocate for them and that i'll do what i can whatever is possible i think that was very effective because in that situation i did not let down my clients they did not tend to get aggressive with me because i never actually promised anything that i could not deliver i think they say that as an honest effort to try to work with them to try to negotiate to try and meet their needs as best as possible
so when i was working on my masters degree some curve balls were thrown at me that through the department agreed to certain things that unfortunately i guess he was at a position to fully execute so i signed up into that program thinking that i would actually graduate in a year and there were times where with this i had to compromise because an issue popped up with my funding where he told me i was originally supposed to go to school from august until the next following summer then i would technically graduate in the following august and he told me shortly before the spring semester ended that he cannot secure funding for me to go class through out the summer then i had to wait until the fall so that was definitely something that i had to make compromises on and that situation there wasn't i definitely did have alternative options i could have dropped out i could have gotten angry with him but instead i just accepted it as a situation beyond our control and to be honest i could only complain so much about the matter because i got a really nice funding package so ultimately i ended up having to have my graduation postponed and instead of graduating on august i had to graduate in september i'm sorry in december but i believe that because of that my thesis ended up being stronger because i got to spend more time reading it so i would say it brought about become very positive
so for my masters thesis i had to be very assertive about the topic i wanted to write about the way how most of the students that were also on the program with me for the most part most of them actually chose topics for their thesis that were either continuation of prior thesis that other students had ran or continuation of a professor's work whereas my interests were a little bit different from the program so in order to move forward with this my prognosis chronology program and i wanted to do something that had a little more of a forensic psychology basis so i had to propose my idea of course to my thesis committee but prior to doing so i spoke to a couple of people outside of the department as well as people that were inside the department but not part of the graduate program i got some prospective from them and i think they definitely helped me draft a stronger oral thesis proposal that i was able to successfully defend
so in the past i had to work with an individual who would have impulsive flashes of aggression and that made it particularly challenging for someone like me to work with him because i find that behavior to be very distracting so ultimately because i could not go on and be productive while feeling very negative about the situation i decided to make a little bit of a joke out of it i started to keep a log of all the insults that this individual said and i would just later on look at it and chuckle about it have a nice laugh and just accept that that's the way how this individual interacts and with other people sometimes and that there is nothing i can do about it expect try to have a good humor about it so and ultimately i felt a lot less stressed out after i decided to take a slightly more humorous approach to it and because of that i feel like my productivity increased from the situation and on the other side i doubt that the individual really maybe he noticed i really cannot speak for the individual but i think overall the outcome was positive because i was able to feel like ultimately i ended up becoming more efficient at my job
to be honest i've been lucky because all the work environments i've ever been in had pretty solid division of labor and in all those situations my employees were always my co-workers rather were always willing to work together to try and make that sure that everyone gets their fair share but i can say that some tasks that i worked on had a massive volume of tasks that were not necessarily the most exciting tasks again that was pretty well split evenly and in that situation i definitely made sure to just put my nose down get the task done and try to do it to the best of my ability of course i think one strategy in general that's really effective in terms of sharing unpleasant tasks i feel like because i'm the type of person to check in on my co-workers and to ask if they need any help or if they need anything i feel like because i put myself out there and offer them assistance and that i offer to pick up a little task from them i feel like i personally don't end up in that situation too much i feel like things bounce on that because i'm willing to take on dual tasks i feel like they are willing to give me a certain consideration and i feel like they tend to step in a lot if i'm in a situation where they know that i have dual tasks so and i can say ultimately that the outcomes ends up being favorable because the task is done and and i can definitely say that all my colleagues work very hard so in that situation i know more often than not they don't think twice about picking up their share of dual tasks
so i'm very lucky to say that i've never actually been in this position and if i were in this position however to be honest i think that how i would handle the situation it will depend on the group dynamics first and foremost if i'm in a position where i can speak to a superior and where i feel comfortable speaking to a superior i think that would probably be an appropriate approach so that or alternatively if i could speak to the person that took leadership of the group project and have a level of rapport with them i think in that situation i would to try to inform him or her of their behavior because there's always a possibility that if somebody is taking leadership of a project and blatantly disregarding contributions that are inconsistent because of her opinion there's always a possibility that they are not aware of it so i think it will be important to make sure that he or she is aware of it before i end up making a large issue out of it and before anyone ends up getting in trouble or reprimanded or before the group falls apart
so this was a consistent challenge as you can imagine where i used to work at a psychiatric hospital my former clients would would frequently get into arguments abuse each other so when one of my mutual roles of course was to keep everyone safe and to try to discourage fighting to try to prevent things from escalating so with that being said i would frequently have to listen to my clients when they would have an issue when they would start to express naive emotions i'd have to listen to them actively and a lot of times i engaged in the behavior of reflective listening which was when i basically repeated what they said but paraphrased it to make sure that i'm understanding exactly what they are saying that was a big part of how my former clients and i would work together to try to resolve communication issues a lot of times i would actually if they i would also help work with them to develop a plan for how to effectively communicate maybe something that they want to get across sometimes i would listen to their needs and write down a course of action to help them get their point across or to help them handle an issue so and unusually i found especially that with active listening things were usually pretty effective because everyone likes to know that you are actually listening to them when they are speaking and on top of that reflective listening sometimes through reflective listening i felt like my former clients at least they expressed moments of insight where oh yeah i understand why that person got really mad at me
so in the past when i had to communicate difficult or critical feedback to my supervisor i would go about it a couple of different ways it really depended on the situation to be honest if it's something extremely time sensitive that required an urgent response i would typically either try to reach her on the cell phone or text her if it's something that was a little bit complicated however something that requires a lot more content to be absorbed i would usually request that she and i could meet briefly so i'll be able to explain whatever it is that i would have to tell her and sometimes one method that i use a lot is if i have something extremely complicated that i need to communicate or if there is a couple of points that i need to share with her i'll write it down in an organized manner so that i don't forget anything and so that i can cover every topic and every relevant point in a logical manner i found that this has been very effective and sometimes too if something is not particularly time sensitive but if it's critical enough sometimes i'll send it over email so that there is documentation that i did communicate whatever issue it was for typically in the most pressing situations i would actually email her request a meeting and then go from there meet up with her and discuss with her whatever the issue is that needs to be discussed the difficult information critical feedback
so in the past when i worked as an allied therapist at a psychiatric hospital i would conduct psycho educational groups and a lot of times a lot of the content that i spoke about of course could get pretty typical a lot of terminology might not be familiar to my audience of course my audience was mumble they were always changing we would have new clients coming in and out on a regular basis so usually for my groups of course i tailored it we had one unit that was our acute unit which they tended to not be in a position to understand more complex information and then we had our other unit which had people that were more civilized so i would actually tailor my groups for the groups that were on the acute unit i would try to make my groups a lot more hands-on and i would move my language try use more familiar terminology to them whenever i would do a group let's say anger management or when i would do a group on uh taking care of yourself so and another way that i like to express this and educate my um former clients is that on both the ends actually i would use a chalk board or a white board a lot of times and try to drill out the different points that i'm talking about sometimes also for example i used to do a group on communication styles we would discuss active aggressive and passive aggressive communication and for those groups i would actually have my former clients act out the different communication styles so i alternately tried to keep things interactive enough where they were engaged and i tried to break down information in a way that they would understand and it seems like the outcomes were usually successful
okay uh so at uh work here uh i was part of a project where we had to do uh cognitive lab study and uh while i wasn't the formal leader uh because i was a principal investigator i uh tried to uh assume a leadership role in that project because i uh kind of was part in charge of scheduling participants and recruiting participants and then running the actual cog lab studies uh specifically interviewing the participants and then organizing the data afterwards uh the outcome of that was that uh we are able to successfully uh run all the participants and we met our goals and we are able to present some of that data at uh a technical advisory meeting uh a couple of months later uh so i thought that it went very well and i felt that i had some autonomy with it and i was able to direct uh parts of that endeavor
uh so to build motivation in my coworkers uh the background of the situation is uh when i first started working here i had heard that uh a lot of people would like to have training opportunities outside of their regular roles uh specifically for different software packages uh i would really enjoy learning more about different software packages uh for statistical analysis specifically so i took the initiative uh a couple of months after i started to uh find out who had some expertise in different areas and different programs and then i approach them and ask them if they would like to do kind of like a brown bag lecture uh and give us a little bit of training for the research assistants uh i was able to uh schedule a couple of different uh appointments with that and i motivated my coworkers to want to go because i knew that uh they all shared an interest in learning more about these topics uh and i found a convenient time for all of us to meet and basically just by setting it up and taking that initiative that was motivation enough for them to want to come to the meetings and participate and we had a very good turnout for both the meetings so far and we're going to schedule some more in the future
so a time where i was a member of a group where two of the members didn't work well together uh when i was in undergrad i was a resident advisor uh and as part of my job requirements we had to uh put on a couple of different events per semester and work on teams with the other ra's uh in our section and uh working on a couple of them some people weren't particularly fond of each other uh but i think i helped handle the situation by uh realizing that there were some disagreements between people uh and if i were in charge of the group uh i would ask them to perform different tasks uh to accomplish the specific goal we had for that uh project uh so i might ask somebody to make the advertisements and ask the other person to uh  work with the catering or something so that they're not working completely uh together but they're still working on a team with a common goal uh in another situation uh where two people aren't working well together uh i guess you can consider the floor that uh i was the rs on a team and some of the residents uh weren't too fond of each other so uh we kind of had a mediation between them and handled that situation through uh having them both sit down and talk about their own particular perspectives and point of view about the situation and their wants and needs in the situation and then coming to a mutual agreement and resolution
uh a time when i had to try and gain the trust of others i was working with um while trying to negotiate with them um i guess a particular time would be um when um  i guess when i was an undergrad and i was an ra again like the situation before um and just dealing with some residents um i mainly had uh freshmen residents on my floor so they were all new to the school and obviously new to me um so i could gain their trust and they had to gain my trust um and i had to negotiate with then often because for example they might be too loud uh late at night and then i'd have to go and tell them to be quiet um but sometimes for certain situations we'd have to negotiate with them for example if it was somebody's birthday and the whole floor wanted to get together and build the community and sing happy birthday to them but it was midnight um we kind of had to be okay with that and say it's for a good cause um you can kind of be loud after hours um but in that sense um i think that's a good example of where um we didn't know each other and had to kind of build a relationship um especially one where i was um the superior and they were kind of the subordinate in the relationship um and there were multiple times where we had to negotiate but i think because we had a good relationship um we were able to negotiate  a number of different scenarios
ok so for the uh question uh working here uh i've had to divide up certain tasks uh for some of my projects that i'm working on with uh the other research assistant that i do a lot of work with uh so we usually get a large assignment and then have to divide it up uh knowing that both of us have other projects that we're currently working on simultaneously uh so sometimes uh we'll be able to evenly divide up the task between the two of us uh to spend the same amount of time uh doing the same amount of work well other times we have to kind of bargain and negotiate and compromise uh that this week i'm might do a little bit more work uh or she might do a little bit more work but then the subsequent times uh that we have a similar assignment or another assignment in general we know that the other person will have to pick up their weight at that point uh so in that sense uh we bargain and compromise but we always reach mutually exclusive mutually favorable outcome uh through communication and we both know that uh we'll live up to the expectations the second time around as well
for this question um i have sort of a more simple um answer for basically uh both my direct coworker uh another research assistant who's working on the same project i'm working on as well as my project manager for that same project um we all kind of in the beginning when i started working here um just systematically throughout the week we'd email each other updates or um go to each other's cubicle or speak to each other directly about what we're working on but there wasn't really time where we'd all sit down um just as the three of us as a small group and discus what was going to happen um for the rest of the week um or at the end of the week what we accomplish so i approach both of them and suggested that we meet uh once at the beginning of the week monday morning um and once kind of towards the end of the week on thursday because i thought that if we met at the beginning of the week we could discus um some other tasks and uh goals we wanted to accomplish as a group uh during that week and then also in the meeting at the end of the week we could kind of reflect on what we were able to accomplish in that week and if we met the goals that we had set on uh monday of that week um so i just presented it to them basically as are presenting that now and they thought it was a great idea and we've been doing it ever since
so first question uh when i was in my undergrad program uh i had a psychology class i was taking and we had to do a group project um and i was part of a group of um two other um guys one was my really good friend and then another person was just another um student in the class and my friend and i were always meeting um and discussing what we wanted to do with the project and doing the research and dividing up the workload and the third person um really could never make the meetings he was too busy um and then we never really saw his contribution to the project um and even a couple of days before it was due um we still hadn't seen anything even though my friend and i had finished our parts and the day of the project we received an email in the morning from the other person saying that he was sick and couldn't come in so um my friend and i went to our professor and let him know the situation and uh basically that the other person hadn't really done anything so uh our professor gave us the option to just present um just the two of us myself and my friend and uh we went with that option and we just kind of adlibed the other persons partum and ended up doing well on the project um but that was a situation where the other person that i was working with i didn't particularly like because i didn't feel like he was um pulling his weight um but in the end i think we had a favorable outcome because we were able to approach um the professor and let him know the situation and we worked through it and um were able to adopt to the situation
uh for this question i don't necessarily have a specific example uh but there have been times where uh in one project i'm working on currently uh the workload has increased uh severely um in a short amount of time and usually i'm able to divide up the work between myself and the other ra on the project but sometimes uh there's been instances where i'll have to take a little bit more of that load if she has another thing that she's currently working on that has a tight deadline uh so in those situations uh i tend to just stay a little bit later at work uh and try to get that done but uh i often communicate with my product manager uh about the workload uh just to let him know what we're working on and how it's going and uh how the time frame is looking for and i also communicate with the uh principal investigator on the project uh to give him updates uh at different time points to just let him know where i'm at with the project uh so when given more than uh normal i just try to manage it as best i can and create a time line for myself and accomplish the tasks even though it's a little bit more than normal um all the while communicating with the uh different people on my team that need to know uh what's going on
for this question i can recall um a particular situation where this has happened to me um but if it were to happen to me um basically where somebody came into an existing project and took a little leadership um but did not listen to um some of the contributions that people were putting forward um i think i would handle a situation by um approaching a person that took over the leadership and um asking what their vision of the project is um and expressing the fact that um we uh were going in a certain direction and i just want to make sure that um i understand what the new um idea or goal is at that point um so that i can help with that um but i would also put forth some of my um ideas in the meeting one on one with that person and just let them know that um these are some things that i've been considering and um that i would like them to also consider it and if we can figure out a way that that can work to the overall goal of the project um that would be great um but like i said i don't believe i've been in this situation before but if i were i think that's how i would handle it
for this question um a time that i had to use my listening skills to overcome a communications problem um has occurred just a few times uh mainly as a result of initially communicating over email um so the project manager or the principal investigator um may have emailed myself or the team and said they would like uh certain tasks accomplished um but over email it wasn't too specific um as to what they meant um so i had to use my listening skills when i decided to take the action to call that person over the phone um just to walk through a little bit more detail about what they were looking for um in terms of the task they wanted us to accomplish um so in that way i would have to um speak with them ask them a few more questions and then i would always take notes um and repeat back to them what i heard them say as uh the steps we needed to take just to make sure that we were on the same and um there is complete uh transparency with uh what they were trying to ask us to do
so for this uh question uh a difficult uh time where i had to communicate information or feedback to my supervisor uh i guess i would say there has been uh there was a time where i was working with some data and had run a number of analysis on it and uh kind of reported my findings to my supervisor and then upon uh going back in to do some more analysis i realize that there is an error in the data uh that needed to be fixed and it was uh i guess a little bit difficult because i didn't want to go back and say that i'm going to have to redo those analysis because there is some error in the data uh but i knew that i needed to sat that uh because the calculations were of so i let my supervisor know uh and try to as quickly and efficiently as possible rerun the analysis and then report uh the new findings to my supervisor and everything worked out better than i thought uh and i think that all of the parties involved uh were happy with the outcome
for this question the background of the situation is that uh some of the projects that i'm working on uh deal with some more uh technical psychological uh information and if i wanted to go tell uh some family or friends that uh aren't particularly knowledgeable in that field i would often just tell them uh very broadly what i was doing and uh to get any more specific i would just try to give uh an example that applied to their every day life or something that i thought uh they could readily understand and compare to so uh i would just take more technical jargon and apply it to kind of like an everyday situation uh so that it would make a little bit more sense for them
there was a very large mailing coming up and the person who was in charge of it was moving very slowly and i felt that they weren't getting things done quickly enough they weren't organized enough and so i went in to the room where the mailing was going to take place and laid things out so that it would be easier for everyone to get things together as a result the mailing did go out in time everything was very highly organized and we were successful the person who was in charge thanked me for taking the initiative on the mailing
we had a huge new job coming up and we were already overwhelmed with work so we were in a staff meeting talking about it and trying to decide how we were going to get it done and people were saying we can't do this there's not enough people we have too much work already and i said to them all we can do this we're a team this is what we do if we all pull together we can do this we  might have to work extra we might have to put in more time but we're a good team and we can get this done and we did get it done um everything went well we were a little crazy for a while but the job was done it was done well nothing else crashed while we were trying to complete this one everybody carried out all of their daily responsibilities but we did get it done it was good we had great teamwork we worked really well together as a team and uh everybody pulled together and carried on as a team should carry on and we got the job and not only did we get the job done but we got a presidential award for it
i was actually the team lead in this group um there were a couple of hundred people under me and while i was the team lead there were other people that were the leads under me in different areas uh these two young girls decided that this one older older lady didn't know what she was doing and they were giving her a really hard time um and this older lady was very conscientious and had been doing this for quite a while and i thought that she did know what she was doing so i took these two girls aside and i tried to talk to them but they were young and very belligerent and showed that they were right and she was wrong and the two of them were not good together so what i did was moved one of them to another group and put the one who was the least contentious back where she was uh without her friend there to go with her along she did very well in that group after that um the other girl was angry uh i believed that she quit because she was mad that she was separated from her friend um i didn't feel that that was a huge loss because she was a troublemaker but everything worked out for everybody but the person that quit i didn't feel that i did the wrong thing i felt that i did what i had to do to preserve the integrity of the work
okay i'm going to have to go back to the same two girls um again they were causing trouble in the area where work needed to be done um i tried to explain to them that this is how it had to be i tried to get them to change their behavior and have show some respect for the person that they were reporting directly to um and then as i said before i separated them i tried to get them to know that i was trying to look out for them as well as the lady that they were giving a hard time to and the job that had to be done they felt that you know they were younger than me they knew more than me i tried to get them to understand that i had been doing this for quite a little while and knew what i was talking about the one absolutely did not believe me the other one was very willing to work with me and as a result the job got done the lady in question was happy with the outcome the girl who was back to reporting to her was very respectful after that and as i said before the other girl quit and i was okay with that
well as i'm sure you know there are always times when you have to compromise when you're in a meeting and you have one idea of how something should be run and somebody else has another idea and and you're so sure you're right but they're so sure they're right also there has to be some kind of compromise um i've been in meetings where i felt that a job should be done the way that i wanted you to do it and somebody else thought that we should get rid of certain things um and only use technology i felt that spreadsheets were very necessary to keep the data in front of me she felt that they were a waste of time um he is the boss so there wasn't a whole lot of compromise involved there he pretty much gets his way um how much you work too hard which i did not and i kept my spreadsheets but i didn't put them out for others to see um he allowed me to use them for my own information but for others' information we had to go with the technology rather than the hard copy spreadsheets um this has occasionally been an issue but for the most part it's working out fairly well so i guess that he was right um saved time saved paper and it worked out just fine
i work with a team of people and we had a project coming up we were not sure how we were going to get it done the boss asked for ideas everybody had ideas um i liked my idea he told me to grade it up in a presentation and bring it to a meeting and show everybody exactly how i thought it would flow and i did do that uh the outcome was that i was put in charge of the big project that was coming up everything went just fine the like i said before my team is great and everybody followed the guidelines it was great everything worked out fine
i had to work in an office with a woman who was pretty cold um she kind of went out of her way to snipe with people all the time i tried to maintain my professionalism i was very polite to her in fact i was friendly to her when the opportunity presented itself um as it turned out she had no ammunition and she pretty much just didn't even speak to me when i passed her however every time i passed her i'd bless her because that made it easier for me to be kind to her uh eventually i moved out of that office she is still in my area um not in my work area but she's on the same floor as me i pass through the hall everyday i say hello to her everyday she says hello back to me i'm glad i don't have to work with her anymore um i still try to bless her but i think it worked out fairly well nobody was ever hurt and there was never a quarrel or any unprofessional behavior so i guess that's all you can do when somebody's not likable is just be professional and be as kind as you can and be nice to them when you have the opportunity to be
i worked in a office with a boss who was very charming with people i was not one of her favorites she liked the people that came to her with gossip and shared gossip and i didn't do that um they were handing out jobs one time for a giant thing that we had to do every summer and when i looked at my job list i had fifteen programs some people had four some people had five i had fifteen um one of them involved working every weekend uh a couple of them were huge a couple of them were small i looked at the list and i raised my eyebrows and i didn't say a word to anybody about it i just went back to my office and took care of business um that's all you can do she was waiting for me to fail and i didn't fail everything worked out just fine um the next year i got a reasonable amount of programs but she was surprised that i was able to carry that off i did have to work extra hard at it uh i did have to put in some overtime lots of overtime but the jobs were all done everything worked out just fine and as a result i think that she had a little bit more respect for me i on the other hand i know i shouldn't say this but i didn't have any respect fir her at all uh she is no longer with the company
we were at a really large work conference um the person in charge was kind of a control freak um no matter what anybody deed they didn't get credit for it it didn't count it all had to be her way or no wayum personally i think that the person in charge is the person in charge and you need to respect that person's position and so i just did what i could do to help out umdidn't say anything about it told myself not to expect any praise or reward for it and i was good with that um um things just worked out i mean the person in charge knew what she was doing she just would not accept any advice from anyone else and we were all pretty experienced but as the person in charge i felt that you have to respect that person's title and so i did things her wayum did what i could do on the side to make things easier for her and that's it i mean it all worked out it always does and then you walk away and try again another time
okay i have to admit here that i do not have great listening skills if i can't see the person who's talking and look at them while they're talking my mind tends to wonder so when there's like a a conference of on the internet a phone conference i take copious notes uh because that keeps my mind from wondering away from the conversation at hand uh that's pretty much what i do i've had phone conferences with my boss with the college board uh with program directionals and usually i end up with something with a work topic something to do uh or they'll ask me questions taking notes is what works for me so i take notes and then after the meeting's over i put the notes into some kind of format and keep them and then i know what's expected of me and i know what's expected of everybody else and what the meeting was trying to take care of so that's my that's my way of coping with my listening problem is to take notes because if you're busy writing down the questions then you really have to pay attention to them
okay i'm going to tell you about the difficult information portion of this question because it's difficult to tell your boss when something went wrong uh what i usually do or what i have done in the past is i look at what went wrong and then i try to find history of how it led up to this i generally do a work document that lists uh the start all the details in between and what happened at the end and then i try to conclude with how this could have happened and how it could have been prevented i then go to my boss uh i make sure he has a copy i have a copy and then i give him the bad news he always asks me how it happened what we could have done to prevent it and i have this all outlined for him so it's easy for him to see the entire thread he seems to appreciate that and then he generally tells me to fix it sometimes i can't fix it sometimes he has to intervene to fix it uh when i can i do when i can't i work with him to take care of the problem this has worked out for both of us very well it doesn't happen often but when it does happen it's nice to have some type of format to follow and it is always hard to give your boss bad information or bad news
well here at ets we have to write out sops for everything that we do uh some of my jobs are very labor intensive uh lots and lots of steps and i found that first i write out an outline numbering the steps that have to be taken and then i do it down further and explain the steps i always use layman's terms when explaining to people i do put the proper terms in parentheses so that they'll know what they are but at the same time they can read the outline without feeling confused or lost uh after the outline is completed then i do a flowchart so they can just follow the flowchart generally we meet about this we go over it they will read through and anything that they don't understand they will ask me and i will make corrections to make it easier for them to understand after they've gone through it a few times and understand everything then that will be the final draft and then they have a copy i have a copy we all know steps we're supposed to follow everybody knows what the terminology is and it makes the work go very smoothly uh new people coming in need to have these charts these flowcharts and these sops so that they can do the job if they need to and as my backup was very inexperienced with my job when i was out of work for a little while she was able to follow the charts and take care of business so the outcome was really really good
uh so the background situation was i was at my first uh summer job i was a customer service representative uh i specifically had the roles of answering questions regarding the ep testing program so often times parents would call asking for their children's scores or other people would call uh saying that they want to send out the scores to different colleges and what not and so i was hired as just as general worker i wasn't really supposed to be a leader of any sorts but um essentially what i tried to do was try to be the most efficient employee there so at the end of the day i would always have the number one score for most calls handled properly and i was actually nearing in numbers as the same regular employees as opposed to just temporary workers so eventually my mangers took notice that i was actually answering everyday cost the amount of calls so they started talking to me more and uh basically i got really friendly with all my managers uh they would often stop by in my cubicle to ask how i was doing and and what not if i had any downtime we would just chat about you know different not necessarily work related subjects but overall we got along very well and they definitely recognized my talent
so in high school i was hired as a lab assistant so basically the details of the job was just to assist the graduate students in anything that they needed around the lab so most of our responsibilities were very dull we would be mashing up food and putting it on a petri dish to see what grows on it and uh basically i had a few other coworkers and it was really dull work so usually everybody was pretty lackadaisical about it so in order to spice things up a bit at one point me and a fellow coworker got in a competition to see how many petri dishes we could fill up and who could do it the fastest so for a few days in a row we were just doing as many petri dishes as possible and we finished all the work we had for that week extremely early because we just got into this ridiculous competition as to who could fill up the most petri dishes and properly spin the to collect the uh food and the bacteria on it so basically we just got all of our work done really quickly and since we had to work for the whole day anyways we had a ton of extra downtime because there was nothing left to do
so at the call center uh during the first two weeks of training i made a few very good friends and we would always hang out together when we weren't in call and there was this other girl that also worked there who suffice to say was not exactly the most amicable person uh she had many endogenous characteristics such as the ability to grow enmity beyond the most of us and a few of the members in our group didn't really like her that much and you know she wasn't exactly the best worker either considering that she would yell at some of the people who called us at customer service which is completely unacceptable so basically we had no way of properly fixing her technique of speaking to the customers because she was overall kind of rude and that's not good but basically the entire group expressed our concern to our managers and basically they sat her down and talked to her and said that you know you cannot treat the people who call us so purely you have to actually maintain some sort of professionalism and you know keep your cool and answer their questions and help them as much as you can instead of just yelling at them and calling them names and you know being an unfriendly person so just through our general disapproval it was kind of noticed by our managers and i'm sure that they already noticed previously her sad part of work
so at the call center uh the standard work day was eight hours but you had opportunities for overtime if the if there was a high volume of calls so some of the workers wanted to always go home early and just leave as soon as possible but uh me and a few other coworkers always really wanted to get the extra overtime because overtime pays really nice so basically on the days where there were too many workers and not enough calls the managers would be forced to send some people home so sometimes we would talk to each other it'd be like oh you know do you have anything to do later? are you busy? like maybe you should just go home instead that kind of thing but usually it ended up being up to our mangers and the way they picked who would stay later would be drawing names from a hat so if you wanted to stay later you would just throw your name into a hat and if they picked your name then then you had to go home so it was at the end solved in a very fair way
so at the lab that i worked at it was a food science lab so basically we had to grow bacteria on different samples of food based petri dishes and uh one of the jobs was after we finished growing the bacteria on a petri dish you had to count the number of spore colonies on it so this was extremely frustrating work for me because i just don't want to sit there and count hundreds of different bacteria colonies because it's extremely frustrating and if you lose count you have to start all over again so i compromised with a fellow worker by asking him to do more of my plates than just his and in return i would end up washing more of the lab equipment so we would have like you know pipettes and uh different lab equipment that needed to be washed at the end of the day and i didn't really mind doing this so we basically traded responsibilities so i would just count less of the bacteria and just wash more of the equipment
so at the food science lab occasionally we had to go out to the nearby downing holes to pick more samples of food because we were studying which foods at the dining hall were basically the dirtiest or had the potential to become the most dirty and so usually the grad students would start running out of ideas and they would start asking the rest of us oh you know what do you think will be the most contaminated at the end of the day? so all of us as students would really just kind of come up with different ideas as to what would become the most dirty so my idea was that at the salad bar there was always this chicken and it was like it was a pretty cooked chicken they just spread it it was a sliced up bread and chicken and so i proposed to the rest of the team that this had potential to become the most dirty because it was a viable source of protein oils and fats and it was cooked twice basically and was left sitting at the salad bar because nobody had finished the previous bread and chicken where it came from so i essentially convinced everyone else that this chicken was the best bet because everybody else was essentially just hot food so we just went with the different picks of the salad bar to try to find out what was the best choice
so at the call center anna the girl that i previously mentioned uh none of our friends really liked her or anything i didn't particularly like her uh mostly because of her professionalism but at the same time her um she had a certain odor about her that i didn't mention before and she actually kind of wreathed when you were near her so basically we had to keep the same cubicles at all times like we weren't allowed to switch cubicles really so we would only really see her around lunch time and uh she would she wouldn't exactly come to our group to try to hang out with us she would just sit around our group so basically we didn't get any of the positive interactions like you know oh how are you? how is it going or whatever we would just kind of smile at her from the lunch group and uh basically our interaction with her was we try to limit it as much as possible because she wasn't very conducive to the customers that called and her appearance frankly disturbed us
so at the call center basically all of our tasks were unpleasant because they were all tedious and boring and i thought i was being given more than my fair share of the work because i was handling so many more calls without actually even trying to handle a lot more calls at that point and so what i did was just try to go through them as quick as possible but i knew that there was going to be a never ending stream of calls for the entire day so what i did was actually press the busy button twice in a row after i finished a call because the first time you press it you're supposed to fill out all the necessary paperwork that went with the call and then but i would press it twice and that would send me to the bottom of the call queue so basically if i was sitting at the top of the queue to receive the next call then i press that button twice instead of just once then i would be sent all the way back to the bottom of the queue and everyone else would have to answer the calls before me and that would give me sufficient time to fill out the rest of the paperwork that i had to do but now that i think about it even though i kept getting sent to the bottom of the queue the fact that i still handled more than like double of some people's calls it's still probably pretty ridiculous
so at the fruit science lab there were uh basically sometimes we would have group projects to finish and occasionally the grad students were asking us for different suggestions and inputs and basically uh whenever they didn't like anything they won't put it in and there is honestly not much we could have done about the situation because their scope of knowledge was infinitely greater than ours and not only that it was pretty much their project and that were just going to be helpers and subordinates to it so it really started off as kind of group project amongst the grad students in a normal sense but anything that they thought wasn't going to be good in it was removed and we would have almost nothing to say about it
so at the call center essentially the whole job was using listening skills to overcome communication problems so majority of our calls were related to a student who did fail to fill out the proper paperwork while taking the exam just send the scores his or her sure scores to the college of their choice so often times we would get airy parents calling us saying oh how dare you not send their scores to the college like they need that stuff to you know to give the appropriate credits out so often times we would just have to sit there and listen to them yell at us continually for having to not done it and basically we overcome this problem by saying on every single exam that they were given for the ap test they had an opportunity to fill it out and say i want these scores sent out to so and so college and the fact that it wasn't sent out was not actually an error on college boards fault it was an error because the student failed to fill it out and we can see it through all the computer paperwork that we were given that they actually just failed to send it out and usually after we finish telling this to the parents they would immediately stop being angry they would apologize to us and assure us that their kid was going to be told off for their failure to send their scores to the college
so often times at the call center we would get callers who feel particularly entitled and when they can't get their way they insist on speaking to managers and so one particular lady comes to mind this lady called about um a one year refund for having sent out a score to a college that they don't feel that they should have sent it out to and so obviously this refund is impossible because they filled out all the work to send it to that college so why on earth would anybody refund that? so basically this lady calls and she's like i demand like my ten dollar refund for this and i was like i'm sorry like that's impossible you can't get this refund because you filled out all the necessary paperwork for it and you had it sent it out so this lady immediately became angry and demanded to speak to my supervisor and so i was like all right well i'm sorry i'll see if i can get him on the line and so what actually happens when the call center representative says that i'll try to get my manager is that they are not going to get the manager because your call is ridiculous and there's just nothing that the manager can do anyways regarding it so basically i went to my manager and i was like hey john listen there's this crazy lady on the line like she's demanding this ten dollar refund and so he's like uh you know like nothing you could do about it go handle it so basically i went back to my seat and i said i'm terribly sorry ma'am but the manager is extremely busy we have a very high call volume today so if you are okay with being put on hold then i'll just keep trying to get the manager so for the next two hours i basically kept call i basically uh you know talk to her again every fifteen minutes i was like listen the manager is still busy after two hours of trying to get a ten dollar refund this lady was finally like okay i guess you tried  your best i'll just call back tomorrow so basically i was just like all right well have a good day and that was essentially uh basically trying to communicate with my supervisor about this ridiculous lady
so the most technical problem we usually encounter at the call center was that teachers would call us asking on how to get the scores of their students this was a multi step process that involved signing on to the website putting in all the necessary information and then go into the right tabs in order to access the proper class to get the uh scores of the students that they want so a lot of the teachers have no idea how to use computers in the first place so basically as representatives we had to walk them through uh every single step of operating a computer so basically we were like okay press the power button turn on the computer put in the logging information to access the computer open the internet which they had a huge problem with usually because you know sometimes the internet's firefox instead of internet explorer and they got really confused so basically we have to walk them through every single step assume that they know absolutely nothing and through doing every single step and describing every minute detail usually we'll be able to walk them through the necessary steps of accessing the site
that's a good question i think most of my life i try to be a leader and i think sometimes it comes naturally to me uh a couple of times in my with my recent company with my previous company excuse me uh we will join the swine flu scare back in uh i think two-thousand nine i was working in an er and every night we would have patients lined up out the door and uh it was a very difficult time for staff members and especially patients but uh in order to server the needs of the patients we would um have to work twice as hard and sometimes stay late work extra and a lot of times um staff members got very frustrated uh irritated with each other with the patients and uh when i was there i had the attitude and mentality um that whatever had happened had already happened and in order to get by and get through the night we had to focus on the future we had to be patient with ourselves and the clients as well um and i always wanted to tell the staff uh to focus and think about others and uh be kind and the way you talk to one another talk to the patients uh you know really the minds that we as a team we can get through this uh and really just focusing once in a while take a deep breath and i was always there to kind of remind the staff members uh the reason why we were there and i think uh a lot of times i was successful in doing that and i also believe that uh the patients were grateful for the way that we performed in such stressful situations
motivation i think is a uh something that i always think about and also positive thinking i think uh when people are having a bad day or they are not motivated or they are feeling lazy um i might be able to cheer them up and uh try and refocus them um if they have a negative attitude uh i'll talk to them i'll let them vent sometimes you just need someone to talk to but eventually i'll turn around and i'll tell them either hey we're almost there or uh we can do this i'll help you a little bit and uh we can get the test done we can move on or it's not that bad um but uh i think being positive around them can motivate them have them focus on the future and and what we are meaning to achieve and um specific situations would probably be uh in my high school setting a lot of staff members would work double shifts which would be a sixteen hours shift and um mid-day when your ten hours in you should like you don't have any energy anymore and you can't get through the day and that's when i might sit down with the staff member or um you know talk with them briefly aside um and just be positive and just you know take a deep breath um get your mind off it for a second focus on other tasks and uh usually uh the staff member would um wound up thanking me and say maybe i did good and i helped them a little bit and um like i said i think i'm a very positive person and i think uh it's all about the perspective and the way you see things in life and i try and uh relay that to um staff members and friends when uh they are experiencing any stressful situation
i think i've run into this problem uh many times in my last job uh at the same hospital that i worked in in the er um there were two um members of the staff that i was friends with one of them as a little better friends with um the other one um was just liked by a lot of the staff uh she did a decent job so i didn't really have a problem with her but my one friend and her would always butt heads and um it became very difficult to work with them sometimes and i think that sometimes the patients had suffered because of this two and uh sometimes work won't get done so myself and a couple of other staff members um that were working like i said this happened a lot uh we'd always just try and separate them the best we could put them in different sections of the er limit the contact and communication between the two and we would try and get done with that shift and move on to the next day um neither one of them would ever let down or apologize or be the bigger man so to speak but um i think we did our best in trying to keep them separate and keep their focus on why we were there and what we were doing there i think for the most part uh it was successful i think there were some instances where they may have gone into it or uh had a verbal argument or disagreement but um i always think that it could have been a lot worse than it was and i think that we did a good job with what we had and the resources that were given to us
well i think that's a tough question for me to answer uh i think that a lot of my employees and my co-workers uh did trust me whenever they had a problem gaining trust i think my actions spoke louder than my words i think people saw that and knew that i was uh uh reliable and uh if they needed anything i might be able to help them if not directly indirectly i might help solve a problem and i think that really showed a lot of people that i could be trusted uh but for certain employees it might be difficult with trusting people uh i think just whatever i said to them it was very important to follow through and make them see that i was good for my word and i followed through everything that i ever said and uh earning trust was easy for me i never really had a situation where a co-worker did not trust me even the ones that i didn't get along with uh they knew i was reliable and responsible and they knew i could be counted on in tough situations and uh but i cannot think of a time where i had to negotiate with someone in order to gain their trust i'm sure there has been instances but at this time i can't remember but my biggest thing would be following through with what i say and meaning what i say and being honest with people and i think that's how i would handle situations of trust with co-workers
well i think this is another difficult question for me i think uh a lot of my co-workers in the environment that i previously worked at um we all took our share of the workload we all got together pretty well got along with each other pretty well rather uh but if ever there was actual work to be done uh i would whether it was me or other staff members but we would always compromise we would always work together spread out the workload get everything that needed to be done done and figure whatever dilemmas whatever problems we encountered we'd figure out who needs to do what everyone gets their full share and get it done
i can specifically remember one uh instance where it was a group committee and um everyone was to come up with a couple ideas so we could throw around uh during the meetings and um i had proposed my idea in front of everyone about ten to twelve members of the committee and uh one of the other employees who i got along with very well um she had pointed out um certain weaknesses in my proposal and shot it down right away and a couple of other people went along with her um opinion and her uh um ideas about my proposal um so that was given the axe right away um but the next time we met i kind of gathered all my thoughts and came back with a better proposal i um had my thoughts more organized um i kind of told them i listened to all your ideas just give me a shot i have a better way to present this idea to you and uh so i did um we ultimately never wound up taking my idea but i did get the floor and um i got my chance to speak and um it was a runner up um the second time we met i was a runner up however the first time they had blown me out of the water and i had no chance of getting my idea to the top but after that second time i was able to present it again and i had a successful outcome and uh it was taken into consideration and it was just beaten up by a better idea
this is another instance that i have encountered frequently i uh worked with one tech i'm going to elude back to my uh last job in the er uh i had to work with a care technician who i did not get along with uh i won't go far i won't go as far as say i disliked her but uh we didn't get along but um every time we had to work together we were able to because we reminded ourselves of what we were there for we were there to serve patients and uh we talked to each other very respectfully when we had to almost to sarcastic manner but uh we got the job done and if ever she had said something uh a little too out of line i just ignored it and i keep going because we understood that even though we didn't like each other we had to get along we had to work with each other or else uh we would get in trouble from our superiors and like i said if anything had happened um or she had said something mean or mean spirited uh i'd ignore it and it never got to a very bad level i mean it was unpleasant at times but uh we never got to the level i think we both kind of knew our own lines our own limits and we never crossed them and uh we had a successful working relationship even though we did not especially like each other and uh i think it was about the respect that we had shared for each other we were both hard workers and uh i think uh i was respectful of her ideas and she was respectful of mine and we got along just well enough to make sure that our department was functioning at the level it had to be
well with this particular question i think i have to um answer it in a different couple of ways a couple of different ways rather um i like having more work to do i don't like to be bored and i don't like to have nothing to do so i usually encourage uh i have a workload and usually uh i work harder and longer than others and that's fine because i believe i thrive on that um i believe the busier you are the faster time goes um so i really never had a problem with doing more work however when it interfered with the completion of uh and the satisfaction of customers and clients um i'd have to tell a person that either they need to pick up the slack or um i would go to a supervisor and tell them and they would either get written up or um other disciplinary actions but i give them the choice if you don't want to help me here it's fine that i might be doing a little extra work but if the whole department is suffering because you're been lazy or you're not doing what you need to uh you need to step it up or i will go to the supervisor andum  but i always went to the employee first and uh let them know what i felt and what i was observing and i gave the option of either um performing at the level needed or i would go to the supervisor and they could deal with it
all during the two committees i served on at the last hospital i worked at um uh both times the group leader was the same and uh she was kind of um closed minded she wasn't really open to other people's ideas so she fits this example perfectly she kind of had her own ideas and ran with it and let everyone else contribute in a way that she wanted to mould it and um come up with it uh so she's a perfect example but um if i thought that someone else or myself had a good idea i would politely bring that up to her and say i think you are missing something here i think this is a good point i think this is a good objective um uh both times they weren't successful like i said she was very closed minded and she didn't uh really accept anyone else's opinions or ideas um but she was fine i mean that's the way it happened and i was okay with that but i did try and i was unsuccessful and that was it
i like this question too i think i consider myself an expert listener i see that a lot of times when there is a conversation between multiple people um there are some people that wait to talk and there are some people that are listeners and uh then you can tell right away which people are which and um for this question uh there was one group member during my time at nwp corporation uh and they felt that no one would listened to them they thought that uh everyone kind of ignored her and she was never invited to social events and uh she wasn't invited to lunch she really felt like her ideas weren't being uh considered um and i had always gotten along with her uh our group uh in our group a couple of people hadn't gotten along with her and uh but like i said i never had a problem with her and uh so after she told me that she expressed her feelings and i said all right well i understand why you feel that way you know maybe you need to speak up more but from that point on i had made an effort to listen to her and every time i did we would have a good conversation go back and forth and to show that i really was listening and i truly did care a week later two weeks later i'd ask her hey how's this person what's going on with this project her work if any uh personal problems or issues or just anything that she mentioned i'd make a point to um get back to her and ask her about it to really make sure that she knew i was listening i was actively listening and i cared and i think uh she appreciated that and she did definitely see once i made that effort uh she was able to see that i did listen and i did care
well this has to be one of the most difficult questions uh you could ask somebody it's the most difficult question i'm sorry tasks uh employee would have to do in their uh work it's to criticize a supervisor try to uh improve their methods or their ways um luckily in my experience i've had great supervisors uh we got along very well um so i was always able to come to them and say we might be able to make an improvement here or i don't know if criticize is the right word but uh like i said we had a very open relationship if they told me that i had to work on something i'd accept it no hard feelings and that was it and i did the same with them if ever uh there was a time where i didn't feel comfortable telling them something or um volunteering opinion on some way to do something better i would tell them uh sometimes jokingly but uh my one supervisor she always got the point if you said something jokingly she knew that there was something behind it and um so she works on it couple days later she'd say hey do you really mean what you said i know you were kidding but i'd say yeah well maybe just a little bit and she'd work on it and it was successful um but i always thought that if ever there was something you could never say to a supervisor um you could write an anonymous letter or a note and leave it for them and that way no feelings are hurt or no relationships are tested or harmed in that um way so i always thought an anonymous note would be appropriate um but like i said i've had um if i'd been very lucky um with my supervisors and i was able to be open and honest with them just like they were with me and it was a blessing for me to work for someone who i truly liked and truly respected
uh that was a very difficult thing to do especially in the medical field um when patients would uh excuse me ask a question about a procedure or an injury or an illness um we had to um really get down their level and explain the layman's terms from step one we had to teach the anatomy and the physiology about a body part before we could explain what the disease was doing what the disease was about um so we had to basically start from step one and really outline everything thoroughly before we could explain what was going on we had to talk to them as if they were in middle school a parent of a child or an adult we'd have to speak to them in a very simple form a very um small words and after we finish it all we had to say okay do you understand? if they said yes we would continue we'd go on to the next thing um sometimes we would use analogies to um relate to them maybe something that they might be familiar with um so uh really the biggest thing would be being patient with them and making sure that every little step that they understood before you move onto the next component and speaking to them in very simple language and really not using any complex vocabulary uh that was the best way we could um communicate what needed to be said to the patients and their families
telling you about a situation that i was not the formal leader but tried to assume a leadership role my formal position was actually a director so most of the roles that i assumed were of a leadership role um one situation that's come to mind is probably a situation that led up to becoming a director uh taking a director type um role without being the director and that would be closing down an office our company had acquired a company uh from washington dc uh it had gone on for a number of years for various reasons uh the company needed to be the physical location needed to be closed uh we didn't have necessarily the department or a person to handle that and bottom line i went to the director of operations and volunteered to uh shut down the office uh i think he was overjoyed that i did it uh that i offered this and uh went down giving daily updates uh right up about what i should and should not do in closing down a physical office was done during a snow storm so it was a nightmare getting down there it was a night i remember driving through a foot of snow uh to the office everyday from my hotel room but uh it worked out fantastic and he was extremely grateful
please to tell you about a time that i was able to build motivation uh in my co-workers and subordinates this is going to be easy i saw a book once and it was one thousand and one ways to motivate employees and this wasn't a book on theory par say this was a book on literally one thousand and one ideas that people had already done in business and i bought the book it was ten fifteen bucks and uh i couldn't put it down read the whole thing front to cover front to back and uh these were actual things that people had done in the work place to energize employees um how to unbore them and energize them how to brighten up their morning how to um uh deal with frustration uh at one point believe it or not i had a punching bag uh in the office that people could go over and just boom uh it was a little hard finding that punching bag there aren't too many around uh but did find one at a store um it was uh an incredible resource and they actually came out with five different books on how to motivate employees how to energize employees different side spins and uh to this day uh i have those books in my library at home and uh i take a glance at them these are actual ideas that people have done this is not a book about theory this is a book about uh what other uh great things people have done
please tell you about a time where i have been a member of a group where two of the members did not work well the first situation that comes to mind is early in my career where i was in charge of various areas one of which was the receptionist slash telephone operators area and this area had an upwards of three uh perhaps four people working in it a lot of visitors a lot of phone calls and at one point uh we had hired a part timer and uh boy she did not get along with another female uh to this day i remember twenty years later i remember one of the girls name was ruth uh they fought like cats and dogs each one of them was in my office and as soon as one left then the other came in lots of crying yelling accusations i tried to sort through the problem each one was guilty to some level uh eventually just decided that uh uh neither was perfect and um the new girl had to go and also at that point the remaining girl who also had a lot of problems with the new girl her performance previous to this was sub-standard and at that point decided that she needed to go too and um peace was restored to the reception operator area
please tell you about a time when you have uh when i have tried to gain the trust of others that i was working with or trying to negotiate with them this happens fifty times a day a hundred times a day and more uh building trust is essential building trust is uh to me about doing what you say that you are going to do to be trustful i remember uh at one point i had uh asked somebody to do something and i copied it down in my uh little pda and at that point uh the other person says 'oh god greg is copying it down i'm never going to hear the end of it' uh until i actually uh do it so uh uh i want to be trustful to others uh and i have in work been known for that uh give me a task and it will get done and if i need to follow up with you i will and if not uh you can be trustful that it will be done uh negotiation uh goes along with that um i constantly based on that trust uh negotiate things to get done or to get things uh and vice versa being in a support staff in the past my job was to service the internal customers of our company uh some of the request that were made were not terribly reasonable but there was always a way to uh negotiate some uh uh resolution i remember someone did say that uh it was too uh cold for them and in particular area it was an open area everyone was quite satisfied with the temperature except her and uh uh i found a way to negotiate uh her by taking off the blowing air
please tell you about a time that i had a bargain or compromise with someone that i was working with to arrive at a mutually favorable outcome uh i can think of a few instances uh one was moving into a old new york city high rise building where we had taken an entire floor we had to do uh uh telephone and ip connectivity to that floor we were not in charge of the risers these tubes where the wires went up and we were actually moving from one high rise to another which were right next to each other the buildings were semi connected but not really they were uh connected only on certain levels long story short it turns out that there weren't enough wires uh on moving day to hook the new office up ip wise and that was a disaster uh and negotiated uh bargained in essence with the contractor about doing something that they particularly didn't want to do and that's take the wire of the of old connection of the old building and string it along uh under streets to the new building uh he was so sure that it was not going to work uh i was fairly sure that it would and even if it did that was our only option at that point uh offered to pay him a little extra money and a bonus if it worked and like magic it worked and we had a lot of high paid professionals up and running the day after the move uh with no down time
please tell you about a time that i had to persuade a person or a group of people to accept a proposal on an idea um i was in charge of amongst other things video conferencing among our many offices two international ones and this was uh in the middle of video conferencing technology the high definition had not yet become main stream but yeah i wanted to start lining my ducks up uh so when that hit went actually the cost of band with to handle high definition was here that in essence we were fairly ready for it and uh at some point started buying equipment to do this and part of the persuading the management team is to spend the extra money to buy equipment that literally uh was going to some parts of that was going to sit uh for a year to three uh until we were able to afford the uh very expensive ip connectivity for high definition between the offices it turns out that it really wasn't really that long it was less than six to nine months and uh little by little we brought up the different offices uh but it was considered uh afterwards an extremely smart step to start lining up our soldiers uh so when we needed to do high definition we were already there equipment wise
please tell you about a time that i had to work with someone who i especially didn't like or get along with the first thought that came to mind was actually a former manager of mine i over the years have uh had many managers to report to uh depending upon the project uh or the situation but there was always generally one uh main manager and this gentleman was brought in to be uh basically a hard nose in the organization uh the leadership had was considered to be a little uh wishy washy and he was the man that was going to clean that level up not my level but that level and i reported to him and he was a tough cookie uh we were oil and water but uh he was my manager um and uh i had do uh be very diligent when i went to speak him uh about what i uh did why i did it what it was going to cost and to make sure that whatever i promised was going to be done uh in the end when i left the firm uh he and the uh subsequent chief operating officer sat me down down and he praised the hell out of me he just uh overwhelmed me about how positive comments uh he said and this comes from a person i didn't particularly like and made my life a living hell and yet uh we to this day stay in touch so how is that i'm not even with the firm and i'm quasi friends with this guy uh
regarding unpleasant tasks that are shared amongst employees i'll tell you about a time that i thought that i was given more than my share of unpleasant tasks again being a director i really was not assigned tasks they uh were self initiated i can say that uh about unpleasant task um probably the situation that comes to mind is we had a smoking area that was sort of near my office i passed by it was outside and uh people were not throwing their butts in the container and they had thrown it in the uh uh little rocks uh that were around the area uh lining the building and i had asked uh one of our office assistants to go out with a latex glove and pick up all the little butts that were in the rocks and um i actually got two pairs of gloves and i went out with him and picked them up because they was an awful lot and um i had a lot of feedback on that uh why did i get out there with him and i just wont really assign a task to anyone i wouldn't personally do myself and i've done some pretty nasty staff uh in my life uh tedious jobs don't mind it all i can zone out and think about a million different things um sometimes the tedious tasks uh i'd bring actually home and sit in front of the television and just do the work and uh in one particular instance i did three and a half hours of work by watching three and half hours of television assembling uh correlating um a whole bunch of um documents
please tell you about a time when somebody took over the leadership of a project and ignored the contributions that were not um in accordance with his or her opinion uh most people say that they're open to different opinions uh and i found that in some instances a lot of times that's not really uh correct they merely seek validation of their own opinion i cannot think of uh a further answer to this question
please tell you about a time when i had to use my listening skills to overcome a communication problem at work the first thought that came to mind was when i took a course on presentation skills and how to enhance them and basically i was video taped for a few minutes and then it was played back to me and my task was to count the ums i listened for the ums and was absolutely astounded how many times i said um and ever since then i try to very hard say um during speaking
please tell you about a time where i've communicated difficult information to my supervisor at work uh this is an easy one i was in charge of facilities for a large firm hundreds of employees i ordered furniture from time to time we ordered steel cased furniture and steel cased furniture is very intricate to order uh there is a set of maybe fifteen letters and numbers and each letter or number represents something completely different um you could literally from the same number have hundreds of different possibilities in colors and styles and sizes and long story short i specked out a few dozen new wall panels and they was one number that i got wrong and it came in and i looked at the panels and holy crap! they have a chase on the bottom which is a pathway for wires none of our existing panels which we had a match had these chassis and that they were not returnable and they were expensive they were the right color the right size the right height the right trim they just had this thing at the bottom i just went to the president of the company um one of the two people that i reported to and uh came up with a plan prior to and said i've made a mistake uh this other thing i'm going to do to prevent another future to have somebody double check this intricate order process and this is where we are going to put the panels where they are not going to be seen um i was a lot more worried than he was uh he thanked me for confessing to the situation and in the end it turns out that literally within a few months you couldn't order the panels the old way only the new way so from that point on we could only order panels with path ways on the bottom so any new ones matched the existing one that i wrongly ordered
please to tell you about a time that i had to explain a complex or technical idea to a non-technical unfamiliar audience uh this happens on a regular basis especially when talking about computers i could be uh either at work uh to people who don't have that great computer skills or even to something like my elderly parents whose uh hearing and sight is not that great and they are not that familiar with uh the way of the world right now you basically just have to break it down in real simple steps uh maybe even um and i believe the term is to assimilate uh i talk about a similar situation that they can relate to and then sort of relate that situation to the complex thing i'm going to try to convey also it's important to look at their body language there's squinting their eyes there is zoning out or are they looking away are they getting what i'm trying to convey or not um so body language is really important uh in this process
i was working in a half way house i was a councilor uh the supervisor for that half way house has uh put in her resignation and of course uh many employees were filing for that position um um there were situations that needed to be taken care of and that situation i was working with the mentally ill adults so their daily routines had to be supervised their transportation to either work or entertainment has to be taken care of um even though i wasn't the one that is responsible to scheduling all of these ideas all of these activities when there was no supervisor around i was the one that had to coordinate the entertainment the uh the uh work schedule assisting the clients with uh applying for jobs or if they had work situations how to resolve it um i thought i performed well um i did not i was not promoted to supervisor and actually someone from outside was the one uh that has received that position
i have fourteen seconds what if um i don't have that experience of motivating co-workers um the only thing i can think of is when i was working for a collection agency um the people just wanted to do their nine to five job and just go home um i was the one actually that trained the entire department to um do the work that needed to be done um even though it was a collection agency my division was to we were working with hospitals and my division was to receive um was working on receiving unpaid hospital bills and see if the people that owed the money to the hospital could qualify for medicaid and therefore medicaid would cover their hospital bill i trained the entire department to do the work that needed to be done in order to be able to see if the patients qualified for uh medicaid or not um um i'm not sure how to continue answering this question um the outcome was that the department did well
i was a member of the pto in my son's school i was the secretary uh when i joined pto it was pretty much three of us the president myself and uh the vice president of social doing all the work for uh fund-raising and organizing activities for the children in school and providing funds and moneys for field trips and gifts and other essentials for the school then we were joined with other members to the pto board unfortunately the president and the new members the new coming members did not work very well together for various reasons um i did not on purpose chose not to get involved in the squabble there was no uh as a matter of fact i was asked for my opinion and i was truthful by saying if i look on the one side uh point of view then they are correct blaming the other side for not doing well or the other hand looking at the other side point of view it was a no win situation unfortunately um i was just advising the both parties to try and bridge their differences look over what happened in the past try a new page where they are both agreeing to what the next procedure should be uh and unfortunately the outcome was that the new comers quit
the only thing i can think of with that one is through an interview actually uh when i'm interviewing of course the aim is for the interviewer not only to like me but also to trust in me and to believe what i'm saying um to get a feel that i'm the qualified person for the job while i negotiate a price tag or a salary with them um uh i guess obviously an employer wants to pay less and an employee wants to get paid more um i did manage um to negotiate a comfortable compromise uh where i was happy with the salary that that i will be getting and obviously the employer was willing to provide that salary
i was working as a technical support with a consulting company myself and a co-worker of mine were supposed to visit a client in new york new york city that had two offices and we were supposed to um ensure that the two offices two separate computers and the two different offices two different locations uh were able to communicate with each not only communicate with each other but see each other um at first the plan was that my coworker wanted me to just go with him to the one office set up the software on the one computer then go to the other office set up the software on the other computer and hopefully it would work i felt that was a waste of time and i suggested that since we are two people two offices i suggested that one of us will go to the one office the other one will go to the other office we can both install the software on the two computers at the same time and then we can test it to ensure that it is working properly and that is what we have done
when i was working with the collection agency i had an idea to uh start uh a similar division or department to work i was working in as i mentioned before i was working in a division that was qualifying hospital patients to medicaid that had not paid their bills um and the whole process was to qualify them for medicaid assist them in applying for medicaid and once they have their medicaid insurance then that would cover their hospital bill and of course the collection agency will make a cut out of the uh expense out of the bill so my thought was to open another company that as soon as the patient arrives in a hospital and they are identified as no uh insurance and no self pay or if they are identified as self pay that i would go through the process of helping them apply right away and uh if of course if they are qualified to do that um i have prepared a proposal which i presented to the uh medicaid department in the health in new jersey uh new jersey health department i had an appointment to present my proposal to about six people i set the date i went i presented my proposal and uh i was told that i was not the first one who thought of it they have received many proposals like that and it was rejected
when i was working um at the collection agency um my division again was responsible to qualify patients from hospitals um for medicaid and i trained the entire department and there was one co-worker who for whatever reason did not like me and sometimes had some slight remarks to me the way i handled her was to not really interact with her um obviously when she had questions about how to complete her work or how to do her job i was professional and i was cordial um but then when she had this like slight remarks at one point i did put her in her spot and i told her look you are asking for my help i do not have to help you and this is not proper for you to to treat me that way and i truly did not have any problems with her even though she didn't like me and i didn't really care for her as well
uh the only thing that i can think that comes closely to answer this question is when i was working for an international company i was uh liaising between the business side and technology trying to um accommodate the business side with their needs of computer software um installation of particular software if they needed um if an employee needed a new uh computer or upgraded software i would be the go to person to try and coordinate the work between the it department and the business side my boss's boss he would go around my division and will tell everybody if you have any problems to go to him and when that happened he would pick up the phone to me and because he was in a different office and will tell me to go and take care of a situation in my division ah that created an uncomfortable situation for me because then people instead of coming directly to me they would go to my boss's boss who was half an hour an hour away from where we were and then i would have to go and drop everything i was working on because he would call me um and i had to always it seemed put out fires that would come up because of situations the client was asking to resolve something for three or four days and that did not happen unfortunately it's my boss's boss i could not complain about it but i did ask the people that ah when i saw them i said if you have a problem don't wait until it's becoming a frustration to you but you can call me right away and i will do my best to resolve your issue there were several instances where um i was not able to resolve all issues ah to the clients satisfaction
when i was a member of the pto organization at my son's school the president had ideas of what needs to be done for all the divisions for the fund-raising for social events for uh uh yeah that's pretty much the only two um and if anybody else recommended something completely different from what she thought um she always came up with the idea well you're new you need to learn you need to have a grace period to speak to learn how things are done in the school um i uh did not agree with everything that she has done or said and i did notice that she was going from board member to board member to try and and gain their vote for her opinion and i told her outright that if i disagreed with her that i disagreed with her and my vote would be different and it was oh the outcome of the situation is that i guess she was offended that i'm not supporting her opinions all the time and i wouldn't say that friendship was lost but uh definitely from being friendly i got to having the cold shoulder and that was perfectly fine
something that would come close to that would be actually through a job interview that i had um was a position um to become a liaison between the it department and the business side i was interviewed by the human resources director i noticed that he has told me about the position in details what would be done what is required um and i listened and he didn't ask many questions of me um i was excited to be interviewed for that position because it had um many of the skills that i had that i could utilize and um it was for an international company which i liked and the outcome was that i got the job
i was working as a technical support in a consulting company where i was a full time with that company but i would go out to their clients both in new york and new jersey to provide technical support on their computers uh we had another division in the company that was hiring consultants they were uh not exactly part time but they were not full time workers with the company often times they would have contracts with the company for a consulter to work there and sometimes they would ask us the full timers to fill in until uh the consulting division could find a consultant to work for the duration of the contract i was sent out to an interview under the consulting division uh for the company to see if they would like to hire me through the company that i was working with the outcome was not favorable to the consulting division since the hours that they would required me to work the client required me to work were inconvenient for me and i said i would not be able to to work these hours my boss called me to the office shortly after the interview a few days after and informed me that because of me the uh consulting division lost that client to which i responded that he cannot pin that on me first all because there were other issues going on where the head of that division was unprofessional when i went there for the interview she met me there and we met with the interviewer and she was completely unprofessional uh just because i refused to work there does not mean that it is my fault that uh she has lost that client we were at a stalemate
when i was working as a technical support uh for computers often times we had to uh go to an office and upgrade their systems upgrade their computers um sometimes was changing their desktops to laptops and i was the person training as well training the clients employees on the new computer or laptop or the new software that um we installed often times a lot of these people were not computer savvy and changing to a new software or upgraded software was a challenge for them uh being that i was a technical support i had an office in the client's office and they usually reached me by phone if i saw that explaining to them what to do over the phone just telling them where to go with the mouse just did not work out i would actually go in person to where whey were and show them in person how to perform their job and how the computer can assist them with heir job the outcome was that everybody was happy all finished
okay there is a time when uh i first started here at ets in which i come from a position which i was in control i was managing a lot of conferences uh so however with this new role at ets i was not in the managing role but more as a supportive role for the ap reading in cincinnati one of the biggest issues that we had had was the one subject spanish language not finishing on time and there were a lot of suggestions that i had to improve the reading quality to make sure that things ran more smoothly uh coming into the reading it was very difficult uh because i was younger than a lot of people and didn't have nearly as much of experience so i was always looking for how could we change and make things better so what i would do to uh give my suggestions is i would go to those in leadership and provide what i thought would be a solution to a problem i was seeing so i would already present a solution and gain their approvals to whether or not they thought that would be a good idea as well so by doing that i was able to put my thoughts forward present a leadership position without overstepping boundaries and stepping on anyone's toes per say so in the end what we were able to do was have a successful reading and everything was able to finish on time
one of my previous positions i worked for the american diabetes association in which i coordinated the annual american's walk for diabetes in various communities within pennsylvania there was one area in particular it was in wellsboro which is about two hours north of harrisburg in a very remote town that's not very big and however they took great pride in their walk and every year i would receive fund-raising goals from our national office that would say you need to reach this area you need to reach amount and you need to reach this goal and if not something is not being done right so wellsboro was an area in which for the last couple of years the fund-raising had declined year after year after year so my goal was to go out into the town and find out what was it that they were having problems with and where did this issues lie and what i learned when i actually made my face to face visit is that i was the first person in three years that had actually been out to the community to sit down and meet with them and listen to what they had to say and that was a shock for me i was very young it was my first job right out of college to sort of find out that the expectation for a community to raise thirty thousand dollars without ever having a presence from someone was quite appalling to me so we sat down together as a group to talk about different fund-raising ideas what were the different things that they could do to gain interest within the community how to get the community involved so by actually sitting down and listening to their concerns and working with them to reach a goal not only were we able to surpass the thirty thousand dollars fund-raising goal set forth by our national office but we were actually even able to surpass that by quite a lot by actually raising seventy five thousands dollars so for me it was a great learning experience to go in and listen to what people had to say and build more communication skills that way by listening and then showing back
so a time when co-workers of mine did not work well together on a project i can only speak from personal experience that it may have been myself that was one of the more difficult people to work with and again i go back to learning experiences when i was young and just starting out my professional career while working uh for the american diabetes association which we relied very heavily on the community to be members of a community to help with fund-raising efforts getting the message out to the community and so another one of my areas was lancaster pennsylvania in which uh for the last previous years they had had a different staff representative help manage their walks so obviously there was a lot of unhappiness with everyone on the community you had people who were vice presidents and ceos have companies that were dedicating their time and uh possibly even resources and money to participate in events and one area where we constantly struggled with was obtaining media coverage for the event how do we get the information out there the radio stations the tv stations etcetera and there was one gentleman in particular who was very frustrated who uh wanted to know how many radio stations were in the area and what could we do to reach out to them in which my response was very naive and inappropriate i said i don't know open up the phone book and figure it out so needless to say i was then known as the one person that had problems working with people and committees in the area and learned very quickly how to go about and improve my communication skills so as not to become that person and took it as a good learning experience and not a negative way uh from the situation and have build up on that and it definitely makes me think twice before i say something during a group project and criticize someone else when i myself may not have the correct solution to the problem
for my second job when i was in my career i worked for a codings company coding as in the paint on your car or the vanish on the deck that type of coding um in which the organization was very small and majority of my thirteen co-workers had worked together for over twenty years so to come into a company that was very closely knit as a family to begin with and as an outsider and presumably much younger than everyone else was very difficult um especially since the director who hired me was fired only after a month of my being there and they moved me into his position so as i had ideas of the conferences that we were putting on for various topics which is what coding means or car codings etcetera uh there was a lot of um working that i had to do with people who were very stuck in the same way that they had done this for years years and years and were even angry at the fact that my predecessor had been let go so suddenly so it was taking the time to get to know individuals and listening to how they had done things in the past and realizing that if an organization had been in business for eighty or ninety years that maybe they did know something about what they were doing however it is always good to try new things so rather than radically change a program at a time i would maybe change one or two aspects to the program and see how well they were received what example would be how we digitize the technical presentations that were given at our conferences instead of just providing a handout to all the reader to all the attendees actually provide them with the disks they were able to take that information back to their companies and share it with their employees thinking that this was a way that you would be able to share the information and even gain greater participation at a future event
anyone who has worked with committees or volunteers knows that it can be a very difficult thing to do time after time and even when they can be what we call paid volunteers such as with a chief aids that we hire for ap readings every year i mean as i previously mentioned spanish was is one of the subjects that for twenty-three years has never finished on time had never finished on time and was very hard to keep our chief aids happy and keep them going year after year after year um for those who may have not been familiar with spanish there is a speaking and a writing component to it so there is the movement on a lot of books or tapes or cds  at any one given time and a chief aid for a spanish speaking was having a very difficult time for the last couple years and she was a teacher herself so she knew what it was like to work hard and work with uh students as well which was a lot of her assistance at that time and so year after year she would just get beat down with people who wouldn't listen wouldn't work with her and did not want to come back however with her she had this wealth of knowledge that was very hard to share with other people who had never had this responsibility before so one of the things i sat down and i did with her is i listened to what her chief complains were and i said okay if we can make these changes and if we can make things easier for you will you stay on another year practically begging her to stay on and help with us and teach us what you know and ask us what can we do to help you in return and from that we were able to build training materials that she would share out with her reading assistance to make it easier and we were then actually able to implement to multiple subjects at the same reading sites as well and through the success of that one year of listening to her and begging her to come back she was actually able to stay on for a couple more years until it was actually a job commitment for her employer that kept her away from coming back for the next couple of years so definitely begging and helping out can work at times and other times it cannot
when i worked at the codings company there was a time when we were experiencing some financial difficulties and i was looking through magazines and the internet to see what other research topics were popular and what other conferences were covering and there was one in particular about a new initiative that was happening in europe and so i was able to convince my manager at the time to send me to this conference in germany on this topic called reach and to get a better understanding of what it was about and make some contacts to come back and develop our own program on reach at our international meeting in canada and so um it was very hard to accept especially when your company is having a financial difficulties to send you overseas to attend a conference like that but the outcome was beneficial in that we were able to make contacts with other people and get some great papers on the topic because even though the program of reach was happening in europe there was a lot of us based manufacturers that would do business with european countries in which their materials would have to be in alignment with the rules and regulations as they apply to europe so in the sense that you were not only benefiting the company by attending you were also benefiting the industry as well and providing a service and with the primary goal of our organization to provide the technical based research that they're needed in this companies it was a win-win for both
i think at some point in our life we all have to work with people who we don't like and it can even stem back as far as childhood when if you come from a large family like i do you're forced to do things with your brothers and sisters even though you may not like them at the time so at a young age i learnt very quickly how to work with people who you may not like at a particular time and as i've encountered this in my professional career um there was a particular person who actually sat next to me here at ets is to work next part over and we had turned out as okay friends but as the months had kind of gone on her little behavior started to annoy me greatly uh you know typing up the keys on the keyboard always sounded very angry and her constant talk about getting married and everyday problems with the venue or the flowers or etcetera could really start to get on a person's nerve after a while so when we were required to do a project together it was the least desirable opportunity i would say um however having learnt from previous experiences about working with people you really have to put those personal feelings aside and really just concentrate on the work and divide the tasks equally amongst each other so you would some independent work to do and then come together when needed to discuss what those outcomes were for the project and if they met the project demands so this way by operating together you're still able to complete separate work and not create continual conflict at any given time ah another great opportunity is anytime you are on-site as either a subject leader certainly for the ap reading you'll come across many readers who are very frustrated with travel plans or what not their hotel arrangements their roommates and so you really need to draw that fine line and realize what's the source of the problem how can you fix it to make sure that all the parties involved have a happy outcome
i don't think i've ever really been given a task that i found more unpleasant or tedious than what other co-workers of mine have been given i'm a very positive person and so i take on each task as a challenge and i also like to be in control so if sometimes a task may seem more tedious or demand more of me i look at it as an opportunity to grow and to getting you to lead again i can't say more than when you're at the ap reading especially in cincinnati where you have the languages and the tapes and cds you know you're constantly been pulled in every direction and you're working fourteen sixteen hour days you're on your feet all the time um and your name is constantly being yelled over the walkie talkies however i thrive in that type of environment i enjoy that type of environment uh for me if it's a chaotic environment but to the outside person it looks like everything is running smoothly and there are no problems and college board representatives don't know that their front readers have stage mumble because they don't like the way the sound comes out of the headphones on the tape recorders then i've done my job you know so if it looks like everything is going smoothly and i'm able to delegate tasks that can be done by other people as well as still meet the demands of everything else that's going on then i thrive in it i enjoy it and i think it only makes you a better person
i think anytime someone takes over a leadership position and is not willing to accept the contributions from someone within their group then they are not really that great of a leader uh you know a great leader someone who is willing to listen to what his or her co-workers are willing to say and provide input or feedback to what it is that they are saying and a lot of times there are terrible ideas that are thrown out there which may not be in alignment with this scope of work for the project however it's still always important to listen to what those uh suggestions are and for me if i was that person who was continuing to provide suggestions and receive no feedback or was ignored i don't think it would stop me from doing that i like to present my ideas and solutions to a problem if i think that they would be beneficial being brought up well if there is no wrong answer or stupid question doesn't always apply i think in a corporate world so you want to think thoroughly about what your suggestions are and maybe take a queue from what your leader is saying to you and that if they are really leaning on a certain direction maybe trying to give some of your feedback that leads in that direction but if you're continuing to be ignored and you think that it's not helpful to the project or the overall beneficial to the company then at that point yes there is the opportunity to go to your manager and say that you feel very frustrated with the project and either ask them for some guidance or other things that you can do uh some of it may just be suck it up and deal with it uh but at least you raised these concerns and you expressed them and you weren't afraid to which i think is part of it because it may be that this new leaders uh half of how they see the project going really isn't in alignment with what the company would like to do
my current role here at ets i'm a client manager which i work very closely with the college board on a daily basis so definitely listening is the big part of my work load especially if it leads to the multiple change class back coming from college board on a daily basis for the ap program and especially as we are now developing a new test computer science principles there is a lot of assumptions and scope of work that really needs to be captured and gathered accurately and shared with all the stakeholders properly so everyone who is in alignment with what the expectations are from the board uh in particularly on just a call today which we were trying to align on the definitions that we use for our pilot reading and samples and so here college board was using the definitions of samples quite differently than the way ets defines samples the way ets defines samples is just that a sample of a student's response to a question and which that response is used to train readers how to provide scores whereas here college board was using the word sample as just a response it's not anything you used to train anyone but just purely as a student's response so one thing that i would do when i'm having these conference calls and i'm trying to listen to all the different areas uh for as scope of work that college board is presenting as i would repeat back what it is that i'm hearing to make sure that i've accurately captured the information so not examples as samples i would say so what i'm hearing is you define sample is this and repeat it back and gain clarification so this way when i then present the information to our test development staff they also have a clear understanding of how college board is defining samples for this project
when i worked at the american diabetes association i would occasionally make the mistake of just walking into my manager's office and blotting out information i since learnt that that is an inappropriate process and the correct process would be is if it's vital information to maybe knock your supervisor's door and to let them know that you are standing there uh taking evaluation of who may or may not be in the room instead of just letting out information so as i've taken this now many years later into my professional development one thing that i'll do when uh there's a very critical piece of information that i need to provide to a supervisor is first i would collect my thoughts and make sure that i've accurately captured what it is that the information that it is that i need to provide does it relate to budget does it relate to read insight impact or anything like that um instead what i would do is i would send an e-mail to my manager and say i would like to sit down and talk to you uh this issue has arise and kind of lay out exactly what points it is i'd like to cover and instead of sometime to sit down and talk with that individual face to face so we can walk logically through the questions that i've come out of this issue and how we would like to tackle them and move forward um instead of just blotting out the information in somebody's office
i would say that the majority of my jobs have been very difficult to explain to my family members not that they are not smart people but just that what i do seems to be very complex on a very broad scale and how do you narrow down more specifically what it is that i do on a daily basis can sometimes be hard for example when i worked for the codings industry people thought i make paint which obviously i didn't but to say oh i design technical conferences for people in the codings industry they had a hard time grasping and i find that to be true here as well at ets that explaining to people what a reading is what a response is a reader and all the abbreviations that ets uses for example cr could have multiple definitions could be a chief reader could be a change request or could be a constructed response so really is almost like talking uh in a foreign tongue to a lot of my family members so it's really important that i kind of break things down into pieces that they would kind of understand and hopefully not after two minutes lose interest in what it is that i'm saying which at times does happen so again that all goes back to taking what could be a very complex thing and how do you make it manageable for someone so it's looking at what the most reliable or relate-able aspect of what it is that i do to everyone and how do i relate it to the audience that i'm speaking to so for example for all the work that i do on ap i would usually start with saying so did any of your children or do you know anyone who maybe took an ap exam when they were in high school and from there back out what's some of the more details are as it relates to it so i'd say okay you saw the students saw your child would write an essay and then the school would send back that essay what my complain does is we gather all the essays together and we send them to our conventions center where we have people come and sit for seven days and score them now there are so many details that go into that but uh when they start to lose interest i think they would but they get the general idea of what it is that i'm talking about
there was a time that uh at uh the time when i was working at marsh um the company had grown by acquisition over the prior few years and uh they were faced with one of those typical it situations where they had multiple systems storing the same kinds of data um but systems that didn't talk to each other different coding arrangements okay this was a system these were systems that recorded information uh about the particular um insurance carriers and underwriters that they that marsh worked with remember marsh was a giant insurance brokerage firm so they basically placed business with insurance companies all over the world um i was that was also the early point of data warehousing in organizations so often and i almost use data warehousing with air quotes because often uh single purpose uh structures and small systems were developed uh to be able to answer maybe one or two particular questions uh somebody in the business uh of course being in it somebody in the business uh  wanted to start to harmonize the different coding systems that were used to represent carriers or insurers across uh many of the different systems both uh that had sprung up within marsh globally and the systems of uh the systems across uh their acquisitions um i took the lead on devising ways to um work with those with folks in those systems to um basically uh determine what was the standard that the company was going to use and helping the different systems map to that standard and devising some mechanisms and processing at uh in the ware house to be able to harmonize it okay
several years ago the first job that i uh had straight out of college was for the fdny and we were in the operations research group we supported management in a lot of different um basically numbers people we supported a lot of initiatives and one of which was uh collective bargaining because um basically that's where um all staffing and really substantial changes take place is through the contracting and collective bargaining process uh we had a very ambitious uh really great deputy commissioner who came up with a uh very good plan for reducing staffing under certain circumstances and we had to prove that those reductions in staffing uh would not be detrimental either to the public or to the firefighters themselves so we were faced with the task of going to you know some old storage rooms gathering tons of paper documents and um we had to build screens this was a long time ago data bases were simple we had to build screens we had to get data input we had to do some modeling to figure out you know to actually analyze the situation to see whether uh more injuries resulted when staffing was reduced uh under certain circumstances in the past so well basically um just by being very honest by being very collaborative with my coworkers you know get in the car ride out to the site where we have to try to wrestle these boxes away from folks and you know get back and you know just so basically facing the task down um making a plan and sticking with it although being able to um diverge from our plans if we needed to based what the circumstances were everything was very fluid the outcome was great um we proved our case and which resulted in the second largest uh savings for new york city up to that point
when i was the director of a relatively small group uh sometimes there was friction between uh two of the individuals uh how did i handle that? well you can't completely handle it because you can't necessarily get to the actual source of the friction but you obviously have to do your best uh basically i always try to acknowledge the points that each person had uh i tried to stay out of non work disagreements because those things popped up as well and i tried to just uh point out that those sorts of things were not even uh that we shouldn't even be discussing or arguing over those types of things at work uh when as i said when it came to work disagreements i would basically hear each person out and try to i mean in my mind i might have leaned towards one person or the other persons opinion chances are i'd have my own opinion uh and i would try to basically sometimes you need to ask people questions to get them to perhaps think of things in a different way um uh one of the different ways being to try to see the other persons perspective and where they're coming from um i can think of one particular incident where i literally got between uh two people and uh two much larger men and frankly that was not a great outcome because um uh i felt that my physical presence between them would stop fighting but i myself became scared because it looked like that wasn't going to make any difference um generally when it come my preference is to talk things out and then to make a decision without saying who's right and who's wrong just saying okay if i'm the manager this is my decision and let's just go from there
there have been quite a few times where i've been in a position uh as a data analyst to um take a look at data that's going to be merged integrated harmonized in some target warehouse system and to determine and define rules for processing transformation um you know error conditions um so i've often had to gain i wouldn't say the 'trust' but the 'buy in' of the folks to whom i was giving direction uh typically they'd be developers i would have to you have to be able to answer their questions um you have to be able to give them all answers that are fairly robust so that um you know which lets them know that you've analyzed the situation and you have thought about it and you have um determined uh how to deal with you know maybe ninty percent of problems is always going to be weird data that you may not be able to plan for um although you need a catch all way to deal with that as well um i mean the outcomes of those kinds of situations just generally uh work well because if the things is if you're defining the rules for somebody else and perhaps there was an oversight on my part um you know i'm willing perfectly willing and perfectly able and expecting to you know take the flak if there was any issues that their code didn't handle because i didn't give them the correct instructions so when those kinds of things happened and you basically um you know stand up in a meeting take responsibility for whatever you've done i mean you kind of gain people's trust in uh i don't want to say 'round about way' but um you know it's comforting to know that you know if someone's giving you directions and they give you a bad direction that they're willing to uh take responsibility and over time it's worked well
i'm hard pressed to come up with an individual circumstance of this because generally speaking at least with my work experience you know work is a day to day is a series of compromises often small uh nothing earth shattering uh i think that my uh often with my role uh as a data analyst is really not often a lot of compromise uh well actually i can think of one circumstance we built a tool to be able to do um uh staffing uh analysis and staffing and geospatial location analysis and uh i was called upon by uh somebody well above me to use that tool in a way that it hadn't been designed for uh i can't say that was an example of a compromise because we had to do it uh so it's not a good example uh the outcome was okay though we felt reasonably confident with the results we just had a completely different set of data as input to this model something that we hadn't originally planned for but um again i don't have any really monumental uh examples of um a lot of compromise it's day to day in the mundane world database design there's naming conventions little arguments about naming or sometimes about structure and you just look at the pros and cons work with the developers see perhaps you know obviously take their input where do they think it'll be a little bit easier and you know for them or make their work a little bit more um standardized and go from there but i don't have any really major examples uh it's every day
there was a time when uh at a particular uh job of mine that we were planning to design a we were designing an enterprise wide data model logical model and uh we were adding you know you're kind of adding to it in sort of subject areas and pieces and we wanted to i wanted to add a kind of a meta data layer that was kind of rules about who owned which pieces of the model i mean in reality once this thing was instantiated not who owned the model itself but who owned the data once the model is instantiated uh and uh we want and so i wanted to have a uh meta data layer that defined who who as a group or as an individual is responsible for which data also defining which roles can be assigned to different entities in this world you know say customer what role or a party and what roles they can play within the organization or vis-a-vis their own organization so uh basically i presented this concept of a meta data layer which was informed by some uh industry research by a particular uh designer and uh the outcome was favorable and we did put that layer into the model and we begin instantiating we instantiated that so as we brought applications into that platform the enterprise wide platform that was being built out uh the meta data was uh we made use of and populated the meta data structures uh which not only governed behavior but also give a reference data and informational data for folks just looking at the model
i had a particular consulting assignment that was a purely virtual team uh everybody in my group we all worked from home and we had no skype or any kind of visual visual aids shall we say so we spent a lot of time on the phone a lot of time im'ing and because of it being a virtual team there were folks from you know potentially all over the country and there were some there was one particular per person from the midwest who i will say i 'did not dislike' i did not think that i did not get along with her however i found out that uh the engagement styles of different folks vary and interestingly enough even though none of us have ever had ever met um i still found out indirectly that my behavior was bothering her that i don't know maybe being a new yorker uh we're theoretically more aggressive i i don't know but um i found out that she didn't she thought i was being too too uh aggressive and too perhaps i don't know discussing things a little too in too much of a heated fashion although obviously there always another person i engage in that kind of discussion um the i real the outcome for me was that i tried to um uh not respond so quickly uh when asked a question you know  on one of our numerous teleconference callsyou know when when we were on a call with him the person who was our boss um i tried to  uh i tried to be what i guess what to me is kind of extra polite it was really to me an eye opener in terms of like different styles because i really didn't think i was the most aggressive person in the room i rarely am but apparently it's all relative so um i tried to uh be a little more restrained in our in our discussions but what else can i do i still need to do my job
software testing is a very you know very important process a very important part of the software development life cycle um and there are definitely experts in that area there are tools that facilitate test case and um design regression testing all that sort of stuff i've been in a situation where as a uh data modeler i needed to evaluate a uh new version of the software that we used the modeling software that we used i found it not so much tedious i found it unpleasant because i felt that i was in a position to not be as comprehensive as uh perhaps one needed to be to test all to define enough test cases and to go through them thoroughly to be able to really test regression test all the existing functionality plus the new functionality um i did my best plus uh i did not inherit any test plans that may have existed uh within the organization uh around prior upgrades of the same software so what could i do uh to find the test define a test plan as comprehensively as possible because many steps as i think i need and just plough through it i mean i had to put in extra time um because i really wanted to feel that i had covered all the bases this was a piece of software that has a lot of functionality so it's very hard to control change one thing test it was um a little i was a little stifled by all of the uh by trying to be comprehensive but the outcome was that i tested it i tested the basic functionality that we use and was able to uh report yea or nay whether the upgrade was appropriate
i was involved in a large project that uh around merging uh municipal agencies and being the operations research group we wanted to be very thorough in our analysis of impact of uh increased uh responsibilities on the particular uh on a particular force and certain analysis pointed to analysis we performed various analysis to try to gauge the impact of projected increase in work uh we the person who was heading the entire project uh typically did not want well people it was almost a foregone conclusion so this so we didn't want to really entertain he didn't really want to entertain um number and stats that didn't that looked as that made the merger look um you know less than ideal uh it was handled basically we need to take our cues from him and ultimately we did because you know this is information going outside of the department and we simply had to we had to tow the line um and which i did i was quite young at that point um but we did all the we floated some of this information with other groups that also had uh a stake in this merger um just so you know just so people were aware that kind of what the numbers were that we were coming up with and whether or not they thought folks who were more experienced than us whether they thought they were significant so basically i kept the lines of communication open with all the involved parties but i did have to really take
i'll go back to my example when i was working on a completely virtual team uh basically listening skills were all you had whenever we were meeting as a group meeting with business folks it was always uh only on the phone so essentially it's almost like being blind so the listening skills really have to be honed uh in order to it made me value uh visual cues at meetings because often if somebody is about to start to talk you don't just jump in to cut them off or at least you probably don't want to uh so but you don't have those visual cues while everybody's on the phone so i developed i just tried to develop be very attuned to even noises like maybe somebody clearing their throat like maybe somebody is about to talk i wouldn't say we had one specific problem to deal with the problem was uh managing the conversation where there were no visual cues so basically a little bit more pausing i mean the behaviors that you have to employ are maybe pausing a little bit longer listening for noises that aren't words uh uh and just being uh really learning people's voices and learning a little bit about folks vocal habits uh some people will pause for effect but not because they're finished uh so you know the outcome was that we all you know learned to work together we learned to be a little bit more attuned and maybe almost like hyper polite because of the lack of the visual uh and eventually we just learned each others mode of communication and we got the work done so we did well
back to my analysis on um working permissibly to see when we were locking on a merger between two different agencies numbers that we ran based on models that we had used over time so not a model that was not a series of equal you know models that were developed just for the purpose of analyzing the merger but models that we used to measure activity prior to the merger uh we used some of that and we were showing that there would be a statistically significant um impact on certain parts of the city um using expected post merger biometrics um i brought those numbers to my managers attention he's first questions was who else have we showed the numbers to? um which i said no one and you know basically uh i believe that the outcome was that he viewed me with suspicion i don't know if uh i did the right thing by bringing those numbers to him but they were we had confidence in their validity or in the validity of the way we had computed them and i felt i'm an extremely honest person it's like i don't i don't see the virtue of trying to hide information because it will out no matter what uh  and uh often with um worse consequence if it's uh perceived that you attempted to hide things so the outcome was that i don't think it was very favorable for me but i'm glad i did it
actually again with uh with regard to that merger uh because we use certain statistical techniques to describe what to project the expected impact uh on the uh organization based on changes that were coming we needed to explain that we so we produced a lot of information and some visuals as well and visual pictures of changed activity and we needed to present that to the head of our organization who then had to go before uh some municipal uh city council um basically we reviewed the you know the basic all excuse me the basic statistical approach is that we took without getting into too much detail uh we talked about how we had vetted the model that we used for the for these predictions and you know that was about it whatever questions he asked we made sure that we had you know we could we explained um he was uh not tech again he was not technical so uh he wasn't asking the most technical questions about the real underlying uh guts of these models um i think the situation worked out fine because ultimately it was kind of 'all's well that ends well' because um the audience that he faced at the city council were not really asking for heavy duty technical details as well so uh you know nothing we didn't have to explain anything very technical because we weren't asked and perhaps he knew all along that he wouldn't get those kinds of technical questions so he went easy on us but we did the best and got into as much detail as he could deal with
i was working um with some colleagues on a report that we needed to um provide that was going to be part of a larger um report mmm some of the people had a lot of detail background information about what we needed to be doing in the report other people didn't have as much of a background so what i did was to um and the people who had more information about the uh gender studies i had them um you know draft some initial information others who didn't have as much um background i had them um go and um find out a little bit more about by talking or reading either some some different um literature that i had suggested i spoke with each person individually before we had a large group meeting then during the large group meeting people were able to um talk about their ideas we wrote them down and drafted uh the report and looked at that report together in the end it was a much stronger report because a lot of the people who thought that they were experts in the area um you know came up with responses you know responses that they thought were understandable to everyone but people who hadn't had as much experience asked some really good questions and so in the end everyone was very pleased with the report and everyone felt that they had learned a whole lot from you know having done it the way that we did it
we were preparing for an annual meeting in another city and there were two thousand people who were expected to attend the week before one of the employees was really sick and wasn't able to really participate the way we would have needed to have everybody pull together in order to make sure that the meeting was very successful uh we talked about hiring someone else or getting someone in short term as a group but felt that it would take a lot more time to bring that close enough to speed about what needed to be done as opposed to doing it ourselves uh so we decided uh that we were going to uh simply move ahead with what needed to be done we came up with a list of everything that needed to be done that the other person would have you know that the other member of our group would have normally been doing uh and then each of us talked about what we'll do this we divided it up and we then worked pretty much around the clock you know checking in with one another coming in early and building a really strong collegial uh team and making sure that everything went on without a hitch and in the end we were really surprised by how much we were able to streamline things because being under the gun like that we found a lot of with what we were doing on the one versus eighteen with making the registration badges for example we didn't need to do it that way uh and coming up with a way of labeling who was responsible for which of the boxes when they were going to arrive in the hotel we found another way of doing that so the crisis situation uh really helped us to change a lot of what we did on a daily basis so we had the added uh benefit of being able to uh streamline our what we did and then because of that we were able to then take on more work so the next time and the next when we had the annual meeting it didn't take as much of our time
i was working on a high level team in which none of us had um chosen to come together i was the only one that um the leader of the team had brought in for my outside expertise and the others had come from different departments within that um uh organization as well as another organization it became very clear from the beginning that although we all agreed what needed to be done there were two members who didn't get who didn't um agree with how we should do it or who should take the lead on doing different things and so every meeting um just would deteriorate into one person saying what he thought should be done and the other person saying what she thought should be done i listened to them both in the different meetings and i understood that they were actually saying the same thing usually um although their perspective might differ a bit so i spoke to each one of them individually um and you know just tried to get to know them as people and then tried also to uh during the meeting you know interpret if you will uh what the one was saying to the other so that we could they could have everyone could see that the were in agreement when they actually thought that they were in disagreement um that worked uh pretty well um after a month or so it seemed determinable at the time but after a month they became really good friends uh because they were able to see that uh they would had a lot more in common than they actually differed uh in the topic or in the issue that we were working and um working together to write a report about
it was my job to help our association to find um adequate hotels for our annual meeting of two thousand people which also included an exhibit hall of fifty to sixty different exhibitors and so and we needed to have uh different spaces large conference rooms small conference rooms uh and also auditoriums and a place for doing a dance so it was a very it's a very um unique hotel that can take all of those characteristics and be able to also provide a very good meeting um for the members of the association what it meant was ensuring that everything that we needed all the specifications were there uh the hotel could handle as well as trying to get the best possible price for the facilities because our members um as i always liked to tell them did not have deep pockets and so the room rate needed to be very reasonable and it is that many of them are flying from all all corners of the globe in order to be together yet that was you know it's an annual meeting it was the time that they came together for networking uh and uh seeing their colleagues and so it was very important that then we would all be you know would all be able to attend it meant that we would need to you know have several meetings first by phone to talk about what the specifications were and then initially understand that yes you know they did have a meeting space that i required for our meeting then um going out to have to do a site visit and during the site meeting establishing a report you know looking at the facilities trying to imagine what each of the rooms would be used for um either this could be for the dance this is the exhibit hall uh and helping them to understand our organization so that they you know could they really take care of us as individuals as well as the the collective group uh but still understanding that they need to have give us the best possible price usually from doing the site visits and the follow-up and having lunches together uh we were able to come to a good agreement in which my prices were always the lowest of my colleagues in the similar field um
i was writing a report for an uh organization that was interested in providing funding for uh to support a program that was going to be taking place overseas as the expert that was brought in to write the report uh and to conduct the field research to make sure that there was sufficient uh depth to the organization to be able to carry out the program that they said that they could do uh i spent a lot of time in the field interviewing all the members of the organization and talking to the head of the organization i shared the draft report with the head of the organization who was not at all pleased uh she felt that it didn't really give a clear example or give a clear sense of what her organization uh comparative advantage was over others and that it would guarantee that she would get the funding um from the organization that i was working for the grant maker i spoke with her and i talked with her and helped her to understand that my role was to tell it as i saw it um and that there was some capacity issues that her organization had that gave me a concern about whether or not they would be able to uh perform the work that they said that they could do in their grant proposal we talked about it at length and i tried to see her perspective i think she understood mine a lot better um and it helped her also to then think about her staffing so she actually did go back and revised her grant proposal a bit to take into account some more of the capacity issues that i had pointed out and uh we submitted the grant uh and then was very successful in the program that we had talked about is still ongoing today
i was working with a group of people uh to come up with a position paper about gender equality and many of the people in the group rejected even the term gender equality they felt that we should use a more generic term uh that didn't you know women and children or women and girls or men and boys women and children uh and my proposal was that the entire report should be a leading report in which people understood gender equality uh not necessarily uh that there are cultural differences and understanding what that might mean and cultural manifestations of it but that it was very important to use equality and gender together uh so that one can break it down to talk about these are the roles that women have in a particular society these are the roles that girls have that boys have that men have but that they have they carry equal uh weight as because everyone is a human and each role supports each other each men's roles and women's roles boys and girls or boys and girls grow into men and women that they support uh one another and that in the end the outcome is much better for everyone i persisted and i said that we needed to use gender equality people wrote different parts of the overall manifesto as we were calling it uh and didn't use the terminology i would go back and talk to them individually to show how they can incorporate it how they could make and understood within the context because some were looking at it from a political background view point others from an economic uh still others were really looking at it at the cultural uses of the term uh and in the end i just kept whenever the drafts came in i would go back to the person who'd written the draft and say you didn't use gender equality uh the report in the end used gender equality throughout and uh people
i had a supervisor who at one point during a public meeting came across as being very shrill and very negative in a harmful way and unprofessional way about a person who had given information during this public meeting she didn't handle the situation very well and what she didn't know was that this person was someone who was highly respected in the community and many people were very upset by how this person had been treated by my supervisor during that very public meeting i went to my supervisor soon after the meeting when i'd heard that a lot of people were very upset about it and i heard there was a lot of email traffic that was going on there were phone calls that were going on and people who were making it clear that because of the way this individual had been handled they were no longer going to be interested in working with us in our project or certainly that they wouldn't be as forth coming with their input if it was not going to be very well received or if the person was going to be publicly ripped apart i asked for a meeting with her i prepared in terms of the email traffic that i could see the phone conversations that i had with people many people had come directly to me to tell me that this had been a fiasco and i asked for a meeting with her and i just tried to as calmly and professionally as i could outline what our goals were what this different groups' contributions were and how we needed to have their input if we were going to be successfulness in what we were doing and then came up in a way in which i thought she could smooth things over by calling this individual and letting this individual know that she hadn't intended to come across as being as harsh she was that she appreciated the input and that she'd be mindful of our meetings in the future and that's what she did
i was a program officer for a foundation and as the youngest program officer in that foundation i was often asked to do a lot of the um preparations for the board meetings that uh involved putting together all the reports and the site visits um  as well as recommendations for the board to consider that involved a lot of editing and also involved a lot of photocopying and being the youngest member on the team i was often the one who worked late in the night making sure that everything got photocopied that it was collated um  that the board books were uh pit in order the way that they needed to be and uh that there was the best possible working product that we could present to the board make its decisions i really felt that having um access to what everybody else was doing gave me a really good feel for what the foundation was trying to achieve it helped me to understand better what i was doing in my field um so that i enjoyed in fact um doing all the uh additional reading of other people's site visits and um their recommendations and suggestions and um because i was known as the computer person in the office um then uh i think that's the reason why a lot of that kind of the editing and proof reading work had been given to me although i enjoyed understanding or reading what other people were doing what i started to do was uh work with them on the computer i'd say i'll come to your desk uh let's look at this document together uh and then little by little everybody else just learned how to use the computer i discovered that was less of a um we don't have the time or we don't want to do the copy editing and proof reading ourselves but that they were concerned about the use of the computer that also lead to conversations where we were doing that that in the end it really benefited me because that helped me in my area and uh gave me some ideas and some linkages to the other people um to do my work better
i was on a team that was providing a report for a high level government official and the team leader often felt that only her opinion mattered and even if we were able to come up with extremely well research background uh papers that suggested that the recommendations that we should make to the senior official were of one kind uh when we would see the memorandum that she was sending up to his office it only included what she originally thought was the case of what should be the recommendation and that happened over a period of time uh i soon uh figured out when she would be working on the reports because usually it was the latest possible moment uh before she would send it out there was a deadline for each day so the briefing brought some materials had to be done by six pm the night before for the seven o'clock meeting the next day uh what i started to do was if it was something that was in my work area that i felt very strongly about i knew that she would be in her office close to six uh because that's when the report needed to go out and i would make a point of being by her desk uh around five to offer my support or offer my help with completing that report and if there were opinions that i knew for our staff meetings were fully represented in the report i was able to say i think that if work this a little bit differently that recommendation this idea would come across a little bit more strongly and that would really help the senior official make a better decision and over time she then began to not sure if look forward to it is the word but she began to expect me to come by her desk around that time and then i was able to make sure that the majority reports were included as well as any descanting ideas that people had and i felt that that was helpful and this private senior official to make a considerate decision
this situation involved an actual listening um inability i had a colleague who um did not know at the time that she was slowly um loosing her hearing um others didn't understand why at times she wasn't able to respond to them um the way she had in the past um i deduced it from i would you know be on one of the other side of her um during a meeting or something and i started to notice that she had difficulty if the question was coming from one area from one side of the table as opposed from the other side of the table and i then was able to you know talk to her and she admitted that she was having uh problems with her hearing um she went to the doctor and was able to um follow up with that and have her medical issue taken care of so that we were then you know in the office able to talk with her and converse the way that uh we had in the past um i think that you know my other colleagues were more focused on the fact that she wasn't responding uh and didn't delve into why that might be that there could have been an issue other than she was um starting to ignore them as being the cause for why uh they had noticed the change in her behavior and the changed in how we were doing our work
i had a supervisor who at one point um during a public meeting came across as being very shrill and very um negative in a harmful an unprofessional way about um a person who had given information during this public meeting um she didn't handle the situation very well and what she didn't know was that this person was someone who was highly respected in the community and many people were very upset by how this person had been treated um by my supervisor during that very public meeting um i went to my supervisor soon after the meeting um when i'd heard that a lot of people were very upset about it and i heard there was a lot of email traffic that was going on there were phone calls that were going on and people who were making it clear that because of the way this individual had been handled they were no longer going to be interested in working with us on our project or certainly that they wouldn't be as forthcoming with their um input if it was not going to be very well receive or if the person was going to be publicly ripped apart um i asked for a meeting with her i prepared in terms of the email traffic that i had seen um the phone conversations that i had with peopleum  many people had come directly to me to tell me um that this had been a fiasco and i asked for a meeting with her and i just tried to as calmly and professionally as i could outline what our goals were what these different groups' contributions were and how we needed to have their input if we were going to be successful in what we were doing and then came up with a way in which i thought that she could smooth things over um by calling this individual and letting this individual know that she hadn't intended to um come across as being um as harsh as she was that she appreciated the input and that she'd be mindful of public meetings in the future and that's what she did
i once had to explain the angolan voting law to a group of individuals who were then going to be they were um trainers who were then going to be the training the trainers of the trainers um there was going to be a cascade approach in which this was the uh focus group of people who were going to then go out into the field and teach others about the election law and voter registration what needed to be done i took the information and put it in very simple um powerpoint uh as low as you uh smaller illustrations and pamphlets that people could have with them so that they can continue to refer to the notes and we ran around the you know during the first couple of meetings we first talked about the general concepts of what a democracy was what elections were and allowed people to ask questions uh that they thought others in their communities would have um and tried to give them a lot of background information a lot of stock answers to those questions we did some role playing in which uh people tried to come up with all the questions that they thought that they might be asked in the field uh and then came up with some responses to that so that by the end everyone felt very confident in going out to their respective districts and you know delivering the voter education uh messages that they needed to do and the registration messages and registration was very very high um when people hadn't you know came across a question that they weren't familiar with they were able to um come back to me uh and i would reconvene at times the whole group and say is this something that everybody is having a difficulty with or what other questions are coming up and then we would role play again uh do more of the um uh small pamphlets or powerpoint presentations and then people would go back into the field
okay the work situation that uh i will be describing today uh was a fill in position for a case management uh group leader uh the leader who was also the supervisor was not in attendance so i stepped in to uh lead the group meeting and uh for the most part it was a weekly meeting that all the case managers got together explain their situations uh their cases that they were involved in uh where they were the status of each situation and the outcome if there was one at that point uh  my behaviors included me sitting at the head of the table just so everyone knew i was conducting the meeting i uh directed the start of the meeting to occur uh over to my left uh and uh just asked that each case manager present their cases while they presented their cases i asked questions about where uh they stood where they plan to go with that case and by the uh end of every case manager's uh preparation i collected all the data wrote it down in um staff format and then presented it to the supervisor um when he returned at the end of the week um the outcome was that the meeting was able to be attended by everybody and all data collected for that week was collected and presented to the supervisor
the situation uh that i'm going to describe right now has to do with a group that i worked with here at ets uh recently we migrated from one software system to another uh there was an error in the migration that had with some readers and readers' information that did not carry over to the new system properly there was about roughly two hundred readers um actually they were ap readers that needed to have their um paperwork their pair less profiles updated so that we could take their information that was in pair less currently and upgrade it so that it could be uh carried over to the new system there were six of us in the group so the first uh action that i felt necessary was to divide the two hundred cases uh into six so that everybody gets a fair amount uh described to everybody the process of what they would have to do it was quite time consuming and tedious work that you had to do uh and it was in addition to our regular day's work so i just basically tried with the most enthusiasm as i could to explain how the situation uh could be fixed and shouldn't have to be addressed again if we would just make these corrections then if anybody finished earlier i asked that everybody uh pitch in fill in for those who were not finished yet so that we could get the task finished we did get the task finished within two days uh everybody was upgraded and those uh two hundred readers and readers were available for selection by the uh chief readers so it was revolved by evenly dividing up everybody's responsibilities and making sure that everybody helped each other out so that it was done in a timely manner
this situation also involves uh a job here at ets where we've had uh a group uh that is responsible for on boarding readers from readers uh we have weekly meetings uh one of our saucers was overwhelmed with case loads work load that she had for um on boarding so many raters for a particular program um the other saucers didn't seem to be overwhelmingly uh putting out any effort to help that person uh my involvement in that group was i was uh an assistant to one of the saucers so uh i volunteered to help with the on boarding tasks uh for that other program uh splitting it up with another on boarding assistant who was there stating that we could actually uh move these along we could get them into a certain position and let the saucers know when raters and raters were in that particular uh position meaning that uh they were ready to move on to the next step which was carried out by those um saucers uh the other on board agreed and we both took on the task uh without involving the two people or actually they were three people in this group who did not get along and um the same position which were saucers so i really i kind of went around the situation by reassigning task to uh the on boarding specialist instead of uh having the saucers uh take on more responsibilities um if there was a step that i felt that the saucers could step in to uh help with getting this task done quickly then i would ask and usually they agreed that they would help
uh recently at ets i changed job positions uh from one department to another but within the same uh area sws um i went from uh working independently to having to rely on my new coworkers to teach me the new position uh i was assigned one assistant in particular to uh help me understand the new position she was somewhat disengaged and not really all that involved in making sure that i understood the whole process uh i had to make sure that i asked the proper questions um and because it was a slow time of year which it usually is at the end of the summer for hiring i didn't really have the opportunity to make this a situational opportunity to learn uh so when she finished showing me the basics i then took it upon myself to uh make sure that the recruiter and i had a good relationship so that i could finish my learning which would be on the job learning uh at a busy time through the recruiter uh i managed to come up with my own system or tracking the work and being able to uh present statistics based on excel spreadsheet that i created and it presented a good opportunity for us to keep track of records and run reports out of my own excel spreadsheets uh and that he was agreeable on that so that we wouldn't have to rely on pair less uh because there were some uh  rumors and some talk that we were going to be loosing that report system and we wanted to make sure that we had a way of keeping our data of where he was with recruiting in his particular area
in this situation i'm going to describe uh a situation where i was working as a case manger uh there was a policy set in place by the community mental health center that i worked for that stated that there should always be two case managers out in the community on a case all the time reality was that never happened uh so there were times that i felt it was important that another case manager be with me in particular when i was transporting a male from the prison system back into the community and that actually uh believe it or not required some finagling and getting my male uh counterparts to stop what they were doing on their case loads which were actually pretty heavy and come on to this uh transfer with me in getting a male uh it was really a client back into a community uh usually it involved taking my coworkers out to lunch or stay and i'll come in and cover certain cases for them uh even though it was still part of the job requirement the reality is case workers' loads are just too heavy and it doesn't happen so uh within the group itself you have to develop relationships with each of the case workers and make sure that uh you help them out on errand situations uh there are many times i have females as well they are more comfortable with having the female with them so that situations uh don't occur uh that could be mentally harmful to the case manager's career and that's basically it that really involved uh making that special effort to really appreciate the help
okay in this situation uh it involves working at ets with on boarding readers and raters we had uh a problem to solve in the sense that we had so many readers and raters who need to on board in a small amount of time and due to the paperwork that we needed to collect uh it was there were some issues with getting our numbers met for certain programs uh we talked about trying to make the on boarding process more electronic we were collecting a lot of paper mail uh we all decided as a group that it would be better if we uh could make what we had on paper electronic uh the one piece of paper that was really important to the hiring process was the i-nine uh for years they were collecting and doing the i-nine uh in uh paper form so my boss looked at finding someone to do it electronically and then what i did was i asked if i collaborate with them to develop and design an electronic version of the i-nine uh it presented some problems because the company really was not uh prepared for uh the process of the i-nine they were more of a electronic signature company so they were good at writing the technology end of the i-nine uh but i knew and i was good at the actual i-nine process and what needed to be done uh i worked with legal and i worked with my boss and uh by the time i was finished with what i had designed uh i presented that uh to my boss who presented it to the higher office and we did manage to get the i-nine out there in electronic form uh and it was through the beginning of this that i started
okay as a case manager i worked with uh a group of around six of us that were considered uhcrisis case workers there was a new girl that applied for one of our opened positions i was part of the hiring process so i actually say that she started out as somebody that i did recommend for the positionuh what happened within two weeks of her working she was not someone that i wanted to keep on to the position uhwe had a lot of personality issues with her she was not organized she was not on time uhand i was the senior case manager so i had to come up with a way to sit down with her and explainum that her behaviors were not really benefiting the group right now and there was a lot of resentment that she was coming in late umso i asked if uh she wanted to ride with me for cases for a while and i took her on and showed her i managed the um system in the community when we had meetings i made sure the day before that i would remind her the meeting starts promptly at nine and that we really would need her to be on time um she pretty much would start out to follow the rules for a while and fall back into her behaviors so the next step was i had to bring her in with my supervisor and we had to sit down and talk about her behaviors and uh discuss how we were going to come up with a way to see if we could help her uh and she was open to that also for a while um the end result was she didn't stay in the position uh there were things going on in her life that just prevented her uh from being able to carry out her job the way a good case manager needs to carry out her job especially in a crisis situation so i actually ended up letting her go
this situation uh involves working here at ets uh with on boarding readers and raters i was put in charge of the i nine process uh it seems the group that was handling the i nines previously uh were not organized in how they filed the i nines uh or track them so i came up with a spreadsheet and actually uh tracked and went back into the room reorganized the whole file room so that all the i nines could be found in one particular place instead of four as it was previously uh it was a lot of work in addition to my other responsibilities which were on boarding and uh bringing on working with international ap readers so when the season got busy the hiring process for ap i still was responsible for tracking all those i nines and cleaning up the i nine room uh when it became overwhelming for me i would go to my supervisor and ask that i could bring on a temp to handle the file work uh it was justified my supervisor agreed there was a lot on my plate going on there was really not much i had to do to convince her except present uh numbers and my time what i spent doing my time was all written out for her she presented it to her higher ups and we were able to bring on temps for a small amount of time i had to be particular about the amount of time that we would bring the temps on the temps would come in uh i would explain how i'm tracking the i nines uh and they would do that task for me while i was able to take care of the other duties that were on my plate at the time outcome got a great uh sheet for my i nine tracking system
okay in this situation uh i'm going to describe working in a group here at ets it all consisted of all women six women uh the leader presents uh tasks that need to be taken care of uh everybody has to contribute to make sure we meet our numbers uh within the certain amount of time uh first probably my reaction to the leader ignoring was more probably justified uh ignoring because what usually happened was the group would fight uh they would present reasons why they can't any more that what they have to get done uh they would complain and just spend a lot of time mostly about complaining i didn't find there was really mush that i could do except not really complain and listen to what needed to be done i'd present what i could do to contribute to getting the task done that the leader who was also our supervisor was requesting i feel that she was justified in ignoring most of what the input was because it really was the resistance to change what they're doing um which seemed normal to me because the bottom line is you had to do it so uh maybe her delivery of not really she could have been more engaged but that wasn't my call so there wasn't really anything that i could contribute except what i was going to do to make sure that the task got done in a positive uh manner in other words if we'd ever got to my turn and the room seemed to be negative all i just had to put there was more of a positive uh look on it instead on contributing to the negative spin that everybody else seemed to have and that was really all i felt that i could do at the time
in this situation i'm going to describe something that actually happened recently here at ets um it involved my listening skills but outside of my direct uh work group in the sense that i was given a task to request that something be done uh for a new hire that's coming into our group uh it was something i had not done before um i had to teach myself a system to put this request in through ets ans when i wasn't sure that uh i did it properly i went to someone who i knew had done this before i asked if uh i did it correctly and the answer was given to me that yes it was done correctly i later learned from the people that take my request that it was not done properly and therefore there was a delay in getting my request handled in the timely manner that i needed it to be done uh i explained that it was my first request uh and  that bottom line is we need this done for the new hire that's coming in into the department and is there way that we can expedite this uh they did manage to move the request along but did not promise me that the request would be done in the time frame that i needed it to be done so i had to then explain to my supervisor that the delay in getting this done uh accomplished finished was due to me not presenting the order in the proper way uh which i thought was kind of scary at first was having to explain that it was my error supposedly that delayed getting this report done uh but my supervisor was actually uh very understanding about that and uh called it a learning experience and true that it really was uh because from now on i would go and check my work with that department
okay this situation i'm going to go back to uh a time as a case worker i actually referenced uh this job before uh one of my responsibilities as a case worker in the community uh was i was responsible for making sure that people that were just released from mental institutions uh could remain in the community as long as they did not pose a threat to the community uh if they did or i felt that they posed a threat to themselves or somebody else i was supposed to be able to contact a judge and get a hearing to they called it three o six them back into the institutions uh when i was given this responsibility i actually met with the judge that was assigned to the county and uh the judge told me that uh she would not be with me she doesn't believe in uh holding these hearings and that i would just have to recommit them on a three o two back into the hospital i wasn't comfortable with that response because it actually was written in uh local law that i would be able to quickly hold a hearing with the judge to recommit them and i felt they're putting me in a bad position and it posed uh a threat to the community because the three o two somehow was very time consuming uh i ended up putting in writing to protect my group to protect my community mental health center uh i presented my concerns in writing uh to the mental health director for the county uh stating exactly what the judge had stated to me uh unfortunately it didn't move anywhere but at least uh i presented my concerns to people that i thought could do something they didn't do something so really the onus was on them uh but i did make sure that my community mental health center understood that what we were responsible for uh wasn't happening
this situation here that i'm going to touch on has to do uh with the electronic inine uh creation here at ets uh in writing the electronic inine well let me back up first of all i have to say i'm really not that technical so for one to think that i'm going to take something technical and explain it um is not really ever going to be the case in the sense here that i did understand certain uh aspects of writing an electronic inine i certainly was not um the electronic uh guru here in writing that that part was left to docusign who actually did the uh code writing but i can say that i worked out the glitches and um like most new electronic systems we launched it comes back i discover i have an issue with the inine uh electronically i wanted to protect it there were some information that the authorizer presented it was seen that i didn't want them to see i went and explained that to my director that i'm going to have to revise this uh and she agreed she didn't really want to know the technical aspects because she just wanted the problem solved so there wasn't much i had to do is just explain what the issue was and i did uh i went to docusign worked with them i had to explain to them what the issue was um and together we worked out uh an extra added uh protection so that we could hide information that was presented in the first part of the inine from the person who was going to sign the second part of the inine uh with a code and that actually worked  fairly well i think now probably the electronic inine i'm not part of that anymore but i know they still use the electronic inine the docusign and i believe it's actually revised to a point where it's very efficient
well i have often had times uh where i have had to work with folks that may not have been my cup of tea uh and uh when i think of this particular person uh they were very hard to read uh their affect was very low so i can never tell they were pleased of what they were hearing or not they were not uh they were not really demonstrative or communicative uh so i didn't have my usual body language triggers um so instead what i found helpful was to be as succinct as possible in my interactions with this person uh whether it will be via email or in person i had to truly plan out what it was i needed to say what uh i could do to propose that question or ask it in the shortest amount of words uh as plainly and as neatly as possible and i always get a response i find that that particular person just doesn't like a whole lot of uh extraneous noise or nonsense uh they like it to be clean and cut to the chase and uh exactly uh to the point um no real desire for small talk or uh social interaction so uh that seems to be so far the most effective way to maintain a productive relationship
back in the eighties when i worked in undergraduate admissions this is all before internet and all of that so a lot of what we did in communicating with applicants revolved around the paper manual processing so there would be times uh when i worked at the deadline basis mission school where we would have to physically hand sort all the uh acceptance denial and wait list letters uh put them in alphabetical order by candidate uh and also uh prepare the envelopes literally  prepare type the address and all that to get it out of the door uh i tend to have the kind of work ethic that means uh if i can understand that what we're doing is it great or good i don't care how menial the task is i will do it so lots of times i was given a lot more of that manual hand processing stuff to do uh than others but if it helped us overall and in the long run was of benefit i did not flinch and i did not question it uh although there were people who did uh i just reminded them at least we are employed and we're getting paid and it's inside work and we are warm and safe and dry uh trying to find the positives to help them do it and also we found out we could play music uh or tell jokes during that time so that also helped uh so they tried to lighten the overall mood uh and the atmosphere in which we worked uh to try and take their mind of the fact that it was kind of routine and boring uh i want to believe it worked we always finished our task as assigned
i currently work with someone who i find um often does not listen to the opinions that she has solicited uh or even requested uh for um their own merits i believe she tends to walk into a situation with her mind already made up uh and if what you say is in agreement with her feelings that's fine and if it's not she doesn't really seem to care so its its frustrating for me uh because i personally believe that if you are going to solicit an opinion you should actually truly listen to it uh so in my interactions with this person i have accepted the fact that i still have a valuable comment to make and i will make it uh but i also know that she will not more than likely listen to it unless it's in agreement with her own philosophy um i have uh welcomed the opportunity that if someone over her uh asked for my opinion i would gladly share it uh  and explain why it differs from hers um but i honestly feel that uh i she her stance uh will uh and her opinion will be taken as gospel and um the folks over her feel that she was the right choice i don't agree um so i really do struggle with that relationship um i don't enjoy uh it's it is rare for me to have a situation where i can i have a such a hard time finding a positive interaction with a person and so i deal with her
i have counterparts who do exactly what i do um throughout the world and in some cases i've gone to conferences with them uh so i've seen the facilities that we use at conferences in europe verses what we have at our disposal in australia or asia or in the uk uh so there would be times uh a few years ago when we all had to rely on the marketing uh staff based here in new jersey um part of the problem with that was many of them had never been to these distant locations or conferences in those areas to get a sense of um what the folks my counterparts in those areas were saying were the problems uh something as simple as the fact that an exhibit is structured differently in europe than it is in america makes a big difference as to what you are use to uh hang your material on it uh to display your material in front of it uh so i was pressed into service uh as someone who had been in both venues and could uh speak to the concern the folks in europe in particular were quite thankful they had me as an advocate because they were very frustrated in not been clearly understood by the folks in new jersey and the folks in new jersey were appreciative that i could break it down in a way that make sense to them uh something that was relatable to them uh so uh now uh we've since moved beyond that situation and now the european folks for example have a marketing person in-country and in-house who is able to speak the marketing lingo that works with the folks in new jersey uh but also truly understands uh other situations that the folks locally in europe are experiencing so it's worked for the greater good of all um but i still feel when necessary that i have to advocate on behalf of the folks in europe when i know that there's something they're asking for that isn't being understood
in my role and sort of like the second banana uh to our uh executive director so um i often am put in a position of having to communicate um difficult or um negative uh feedback to my boss uh my usual approach is to take it head on uh to go in and ask her if she has a moment or time that i need to discuss something with her and we all know that since she has an open door policy if you shut the door it is of great importance so uh that's the first uh indicator uh the second is i will let her know i do have something important to share with you um and let me know if this is a good time or not uh i always try to do it face to face uh there are times though between my travel schedule and hers' uh where it has to be done uh without us being in the same location and if that's the case then i usually call her cell um to say that i need to speak with her uh about something i find it's much important for her to hear my voice uh to get a better read uh if she can't see me of what this uh information is  saying and the import of it uh and i think certainly when i can hear her voice in response uh  or see her reactions then i feel that uh i was able to communicate effectively and she understood what i had to say uh and that if necessary together we can work on a solution um otherwise i simply ask her 'would you like to take sometime and think about it and get back to me or how would you like to proceed?' um i do respect the fact that first and foremost she is our boss uh and any decision really is hers uh to be made unless she's asked me to take the lead on something then i certainly can and i do
in my role as client facing advocate for two of the programs here at ets i'm often put in situations where the public that i'm speaking to are not technical people uh they're not the it uh or even the institution research folks on the university campus who might very quickly understand what i'm saying so i have to look for ways to explain complicated or even statistical uh research methods uh or technical functioning of operations in a very simple way to non technical non uh statistically oriented people non math oriented people uh and in many cases it's ironic since i'm not math oriented myself uh and i'm not the most technical person either but what i do then is i do my best to try and understand the concept uh asking questions before i leave the company uh of those so that i can create an example that makes sense to me uh in its most simple terms something that i would understand something that i can relate to with my experience of my years as an admissions officer or uh in some other aspect of my life so that if its common enough most of the audience of course will understand it uh i find doing that takes the frustration and confusion out of the concept uh and helps to make sure that we are not speaking uh ets language or uh psychometrician language uh as a matter of fact i even had to explain the word 'psychometrician' uh at one university when i was presenting to the graduate faculty uh because they did not understand what that was very easily i could have chosen another set of words which i did from that presentation onwards but it just never occurred to me that they wouldn't know that uh so sometimes you won't know uh that you are approaching a task or a technical uh complicated phrase uh in somebody's background until they tell you but the ability to always break it down really does help
to be perfectly honest with you although i have been here at ets for forty years i cannot remember a single work situation in which i was not the formal leader but tried to assume a leadership role and there haven't been many recent work situations in which i was the formal leader either because leadership roles are generally is something i've avoided at every opportunity uh my attitude has typically been to do my job and avoid being responsible for anybody else doing their job so i cannot honestly answer this question
this is really very embarrassing because i don't think that i've ever been in the position of trying to build motivation in my coworkers or subordinates in the first place i've never had any subordinates it's something i've avoided at every opportunity and the second place building motivation in my coworkers is something i never worried about my coworkers have always been highly motivated and i have too and so we've always been in a position of trying to work together to get a job done i can't think of a single situation where i've been working with somebody who needed to be motivated we are all motivated we are trying to do the best we can all the time and uh so i think this question simply doesn't apply to my experience
now this is a very interesting story it's a story of how i narrowly avoided becoming somebody's supervisor what happened was my data analyst was having trouble getting along with her supervisor and the group head came and asked me if i would be willing to be the supervisor for my data analyst and i said yes i would do it under one condition now at that time we had a performance appraisal system that was based on allocating points and there were certain number of points that could be allocated and they were a total maximum number of points for the entire stat analysis units that you couldn't exceed and so what i said to the group head was here is my condition uh if there are not enough rating points to go around for me to give a data analyst the rating i think she deserves i can accept uh but if somebody tries to uh make me put in negative comments to justify giving her a lower rating i won't do that and if somebody else puts them in puts the negative comment that i didn't put in i won't sign it and if that's okay then i'm willing to be her supervisor and my group head said okay well i'll check with the director of stat analysis and a couple of days later he came back to me and he said i'll be her supervisor meaning he would so that's how i narrowly escaped becoming somebody's supervisor and it's also how i verified my suspicion that there was something going on with those performance ratings that was not exactly uh on the up and up
this is another one of those questions that just doesn't apply to my job and the way i do it i don't try to negotiate with my coworkers or the people i work with there is nothing to negotiate we are trying to do the best job we can the only time that i've ever been involved in something that really resembled negotiation was the time i was in a meeting with a program director and a test developer and i was the statistician at the meeting and it had to do with uh cost estimation and the program director was one of these people who believes in negotiation and so the test developer was giving him assessments and the program director was trying to talk him into lower numbers and uh the test developer had given him his best estimates and finally i said to the uh program director i said look he's giving you his best honest guess first i should explain that the uh program director had said well i view this as a process of negotiation and so what i said at that point i couldn't stay on the sidelines any longer so i said look if he knows that you are going to try to talk him down he's going to give you an artificially inflated estimate so the question is do you want his best honest estimate or you want to play games? so uh no negotiation
i actually cannot think of the time when i had to bargain or compromise with somebody i was working with that we'd arrive at a mutually favorable outcome i can think of sometimes where i would have liked to have been able to do that but i couldn't and i can tell you about one of those and the outcome wasn't very uh good for me or for ets uh and that was the situation where we had to equate some test scores for which we really needed to have what we call a rescoring sample which means getting some papers from a previous administration of a test and having them rescored and the coworker i was working with said there's no time for that and i said well then i don't know we really can't do a good job of equating these tests if we don't have that information she said well there's no time in the schedule to allow for it i said well i don't know what we can do and she said well you got one day to decide and so i came back the next day and decided and i wish if i had one decision in my career to take or do over again it would be this one i said okay we'll do the best we can to equate the scores without that information  and that's what we tried to do and the result was a disaster for ets probably the greatest disaster in terms of reporting of incorrect scores that ets has ever had um because there was no opportunity to bargain or compromise and in fact it was not even any time she would have given me advice i tried to go to my group head for advice my group head was off taking a quality control course i tried to go to the director of stat analysis she was unavailable she was on a business trip i tried to go to some experienced colleagues and i couldn't find any of them within the twenty-four hours that i was given to make the decision and i made the wrong decision and i've regretted it ever since and regretted it on many times and so ets reported a lot of wrong scores incurred some huge expenses and i was basically the person responsible and i have to live with that
there have been lots of occasions where i have tried to get people to go along with something i was suggesting when i was suggesting a new way of doing something and in most cases there hasn't been much persuasion required because i'm in a technical area of ets and when i come up with a solution if i present it to people who are technically competent they can usually see the advantages of it and typically when they see the advantages of if they see the advantages of something i'm proposing typically they'll accept it and there's not a great deal of persuasion required the only time that uh of course there are some cases where ideas i've suggested haven't uh been accepted and it's a case of not only persuasion not being required but it's simply not possible because uh well in many cases things i've suggested were not accepted for reasons that had nothing to do with the statistical advantages or disadvantages of it uh i can think especially one meeting i had with the president of ets and me and my boss from statistics and uh ets's general council and some people from test development  and the question was whether or not a certain test should have a single sixty minute a single forty-five minute essay or three fifteen minute essays and my boss and i argued for the fifteen minute essays because it would produce a much more reliable score the lawyer ets's general council agreed with us and the test developers uh gave some arguments which made no sense to me and still doesn't something about writing across the curriculum and to my utter and complete amazement the president of ets decided to go with the single forty-five minute essay disregarding the advice from both her statisticians and her lawyers and at that point i began to lose my faith in the judgment of ets's president and that president didn't do well
i had a coworker that i worked with occasionally who was difficult um she wanted lots of collegial discussion and what collegial discussion meant to her was that basically she would argue with you until you accepted what uh she was saying as being the right answer and she didn't like to take she didn't want to she never wanted to agree to disagree i mean there's some issues on which reasonable people can reasonably disagree um in her mind uh if there was disagreement that just meant that you hadn't listened to her enough to be persuaded to her point of view and meetings with her could go on for a very long time and so what i eventually would do would be to avoid meetings with her and i would i'd try to communicate with her either uh in writing or um sometimes um if if i directly discussed an issue i'd try to make it at a time when i didn't have much time to spend because she would spend literally two hours now it just happened that uh  we had a uh a test developer working with us who was the kind of person who can't say anything briefly and uh he wanted to meet with me about something and i somehow arranged things so that he could meet with her i thought this would be fun and uh so they had the meeting and i found out the next day that their meeting had lasted for two hours and it's only because their the the work day was over that they finally agreed to stop but uh in general uh i dealt with the situation byuh i would say okay we'll have to agree to disagree and if she she wouldn't accept it i would make myself unavailable uh and we succeeded in working together fairly smoothly most of the time and when there was a case when we didn't simply agree um then uh i would simply withdraw from the discussion because i didn't have infinite amount of time to spend trying to convince her to my point of view and uh if i found hers unconvincing i wasn't likely to be persuaded
i can't really think of a time when i felt as if i was being given more than my share of the boring tedious tasks that have to be done and there are tasks like that involving stat analysis and uh we all do them we all know that they have to be done and we pitch in and we do our share and i never really felt as if i was being asked to do more than my share uh however there have been times when i would read in the uh ets uh internal website about interesting projects that were going on and i would think 'there is a lot of interesting work going on in this company and i'm not doing any of it' and at that point i finally decided to apply for a job in another area of ets and of course i went and i had the job interview um and this must have been about fifteen years ago i guess um i interviewed for the job and i waited because things happen slowly in ets i waited and i waited and meanwhile i continued to do my job and eventually i got some interesting work and by the time uh they were ready to make a decision on this position i had a applied for somebody called me and asked me was i was still interested and by that time i had gotten two interesting projects to work on so i said no but i can't honestly say there's a time when i felt like i had been assigned more than my share of the uh unpleasant tasks um it just hasn't happened i've been assigned my share i've done it you have to pitch in and do your job
i hate to disappoint you but i cannot honestly think of a time when someone took over the leadership of a group project i was involved with and ignored the contributions that weren't in accordance with his or her own opinion i can't even think of a time when somebody took over the leadership of a group project who wasn't supposed to be the leader uh typically when there's a group there is a person who is the leader uh and so i can't even think of a case where i've had to work with a leader who just ignored the contributions that weren't in accordance with his or her own opinion in the case of a group project i just can't think of any occurrence uh i've been at ets forty years uh maybe i've been unusually lucky but i have not had that happen
i'm sure there had been times when i did have to use my listening skills to overcome a communication problem at work but i'm having trouble thinking of a single specific case when i had to do that i know that i'm often asked to translate uh technical uh concepts into language that non-technical people can understand and when you do that if you're interacting with them face to face you know in real time then you have to listen to what they're saying so that you can see what it is that they don't understand and i do this all the time when i'm consulting with people who come to me with statistical questions i have to listened inferring the first place you have to listen to hear what they're really asking because sometimes what they think they're asking isn't what they really isn't they'll ask you a question and sometimes the question isn't exactly what they need to know and by listening carefully and asking the right questions and response you can find out what the problem really is and sometimes what the problem really is is not what they think it is uh  and that happens very often when people ask you technical questions uh so i do have to use my listening skills there another way i have to use my listening skills is that uh a large number probably the majority of my younger colleagues are not native english speakers and their english is quite good considering that they're not native speakers but still uh sometimes they have difficulties but uh more commonly it's not a question of limited english skills it's a question of the perception of the problem sometimes their perception of the problem isn't what the problem really is and so you have to ask probing questions to find out what it is they're trying to accomplish and then you realize uh that the answer to the question that they really need answered is not necessary the answer to the question they actually asked
without a doubt the most difficult information that i have ever had to communicate to my supervisor was the information that we had recorded a large number of scores that were incorrect they were incorrect because we had done a statistical operation in a way that wasn't the best way we could have done it and that i was the person responsible and what i did was to explain what had happened how we had gotten into the situation that we were in and what i was doing to get us out of it and first of all how i discovered that we have this problem because we didn't realize originally that the scores that there was any problems with the scores but when i investigated i questioned about it and discovered much to my shock that we had that's when i discovered that we had recorded a lot of wrong scores and then i had to explain how it had happened and uh it was a rather complicated technical explanation step by step there were a number of steps that which we could have avoided but didn't i could think of three ways that we could have avoided the problem but we didn't and i had to explain how i discovered the problem how i established that there was a problem and i had to explain um how the problem occurred what we had done that had caused the problem to occur and what we could do to rectify the situation and in this decision when i think all the way up to the president of the ets who decided that we would rectify the situation by sparing no expense and redoing all the scores and getting it right to the extent that it was possible and then i directed the effort to do it right the way i really wished i had insisted on doing it from the beginning and the outcome was that we corrected all the incorrect scores but we still got sued and wound up paying millions literally millions of dollars in damages
you asked me to explain to you about a time when i had to explain a complex or technical idea to a non-technical or unfamiliar audience well it's difficult to pick a single time because i do this all the time it's one of the major parts of my job uh i give classes to new ets employees uh some of them in a technical position but some them not i give classes of item analysis uh equating i do a class called 'scores and score scales' i give a class on reliability and validity and i study a great deal of time uh first of all deciding what it is that the people i'm going to be talk to need to know about this particular subject because if you're talking to a group of people who are going to work in stat analysis what they need to know is not necessarily the same thing uh that people who are going to be working in test development need to know there will be a large amount overlap but it won't be exactly the same and what they bring to the uh class before they come in also varies tremendously so there's a wide range of background knowledge in addition  and i have to figure out what it is that people really need to know and then i have to figure out ways to explain it uh so that they can understand it easily one thing i've found is that you don't throw formulas at people because uh i know i can't learn way and i don't think many people can you can't throw a bunch of formulas up on the screen that simply doesn't hold uh i use words short simple phrases wherever possible use a lot of pictures when i can explain something with a diagram and the simpler the diagram the better in general uh if you have to show a relationship between numbers graphs are good uh i've tried to organize the presentation and powerpoint by the way has been a wonderful aid in this uh i started doing this in the pre-powerpoint days but now that i use powerpoint i think i found i can use it very effectively but i have to remind myself constantly not to try to put too much information on a slide uh three or four phrases on a slide is about it uh i could go on a long time about how to get from a presentation to an action
during one of our team meetings someone started speaking and they got off track so i proceeded to say to agree with what they were saying and then i continued to say okay and now i'm moving forward let's continue let's get back on the subject and we ultimately ended our meeting in time which was one hour
once again this was at a team meeting and it was very recent because i had just celebrated being here for twenty five years i said it was a great company to work for and they were seemed pretty excited that they were all working here at ets and i also brought some cupcakes but that was also in celebration of our supervisor's birthday actually we all pitched in there i brought the cupcakes others brought like the paper goods uh and there's only five of us so it's a nice small group and we all talked about anything and everything except for work so it was a very nice outcome
see there was time when i was in a group where there were two consultants and they did not work well together one of them felt as though they were doing more work than the other one was doing and to be perfectly honest i sort of of course did not take sides but i also did not try to convince one you know that they really should like the other one and i think that's what it was it was more of a personality clash as opposed to their work they were both good workers uh one was more detailed than the other and i think they felt as though they were doing more work um at least that was in the past unfortunately neither one of them um they're still here so i really didn't try to change the situation
probably the most recent thing that comes to mind is well helping someone work on a project of theirs i felt that there could be more efficient ways of doing that project so i said i had some suggestions that they could look at or listen to and maybe you know we can the work can be done without a lot of additional help and i said let me just show you what i think that can be done and here's one thing i think that could be streamlined and they actually said yes i think you are right and i had inquired as to why it was being done you know that way and the response was because that's the way it's always been done evidently for thirty years so we did try it um in a little more streamlined way and there were other ways that it could have also been done more efficiently but i certainly was not going to try to take it over which i wouldn't want to do anyway and so as of this day things are a couple of things are being done more efficiently um at my suggestion and so far things have worked out
i think the answer to this is also the previous uh response to question number four uh once again by assisting someone with their project i found some more efficient ways certain small details could be performed but with less effort yet the outcome would be the same which is the outcome that they wanted actually i wouldn't say this was an actual bargain or a compromise it was just working with others and giving them the outcome that they wanted
there was a time again i was helping to work on a group's project and there was a lot of paper involved i suggested that these be sent to it was actually committee members by way of emails because they all had an email address um this wound being accepted as a good idea i said and instead of keeping paper copies this could all be kept electronically and one of the group members agreed one that i was helping her with that it could be kept electronically and the communications with committee members could also be electronic and they were sent by way of emails and certain documents as attachments to those emails and now they are all kept in a folder an electronic folder
this hasn't happened too often in my work experience but unfortunately being at the level that i am at i have to interact with people uh with respect and i may not like these people but i will respect the positions that they hold so i will interact with them strictly on a business level and will complete the work that i've been asked to do and how i've been asked to do it and therefore i will interact with these interacted with that person on a professional level there's not too much i can do or certainly i cannot change anything but i will do what is expected of me and actually continue to do so with this particular person
being an admin professional or a professional admin i am asked to multi-tasks and through different applications there was a time when uh there were three four admins and they all found other positions and i was left to support approximately ninty people and this was for about a year then i was i said you know i really do need some help and at the time they did hire uh a temp to be my back up unfortunately that person was being monopolized by a group a small group of people with their work so once again i was uh supporting admin work for about ninty people then unfortunately i took ill suddenly so they hired someone and that was a very big help to me and they did realize once i was unable once i was out they realized that i did a lot and did need help so when i came back after being out uh there was someone who was hired and who had actually was familiar with ets policies and procedures so that was definitely a big help it wasn't like i had to train someone so we got along great that person is no longer here but i always since then i've been given help
i would say every time that there is a group or team meeting uh i always have to use my listening skills mainly because there may be certain items brought up that i do not particularly agree with however i do realize that that's the way things are going to be and so i do listen and well at times still use my own professional ideas and work style to for the outcome to still be what is expected
see there was a time when i was asked to give feedback on some temps that were hired um one in particular and i did give feedback it was critical feedback that was positive as well as um not so positive and i was honest the outcome was that the person was still given work to do and but evidently she was being watched as well and eventually it was felt that it was not a good fit and someone else was eventually hired this person actually felt that and heard that and her exact words were 'the jobs that she was given to do were not what she was um expecting was not what she was signed up to do' so she eventually did leave as well she was let go but actually i found out recently that she found another job a permanent job not as a temp so i was glad for that
i was actually never put into a position where i had to explain a complex or technical idea to a non-technical or unfamiliar audience i've actually had very technical people who have explained ideas to me that were above my technical experience or knowledge so i've actually been on the other end i've actually learned i was actually i would say one of them is non-technical or unfamiliar audience participants and i've learned a lot by people who are very technical familiar very technical knowledgeable and have explained things to me
i had uh been assigned to uh prepare a uh white paper and i believe a powerpoint presentation for uh presentation for the board of trustees this was last year and uh i was uh my duty was responsible for gathering all the information for different uh presenters on different products and uh services different uh areas and lines of business uh throughout the company so it was uh a lot of information in different places different types of information uh and uh i wasn't the leader of the uh entire project but uh i was uh responsible for gathering of the data organizing it and uh putting it into a narrative a clear narrative a clear and colorful narrative presentation for uh top officers and uh what i did to uh follow through with that was uh just to take the responsibility on myself not to ask anybody else to prove uh see if they could get me uh speak to somebody else to get at the data reach out to specific uh directors executive directors and vice presidents to gather the information that i thought i needed including uh charts and statistics but also uh marketing plans and uh uh business analysis and uh my uh role was to just put it to get the information collect it and put it all together and uh i consider that uh my role to have been the leader in organizing that uh presentation and what the outcome was i got the uh material in on time and white paper and uh powerpoints and uh it was presented i sent to the board of trustees and was successful
this is a little uh uh tricky i suppose uh i tend to work on my own not in teams very much but uh i do uh uh as a writer uh people give me assignments um pump your hair for clients so as the middle person the client the the project person and me so i would get an assignment from the project person but uh they often uh don't have the same feel for the kind of information i would need to do the writing which is understandable it's not their expertise uh so in one instance uh i was given an assignment and it's often very spare specifications again very understandable uh and i have this impression that they're very busy people the project managers and i think they are and i try not to load them up or uh drown them in questions about uh 'i need this i need that i need the other thing' um but there is there are times when uh it would be helpful to have some other information and to go through them because uh it's often appropriate way to work to not go around people but to go work with them  and this whole particular assignment it was not a big assignment but uh i needed some information on the ets cares plan campaign um and i wanted some information that would help me approach the writing or the story from a different angle and uh i could have done the assignment without it but i explained uh fairly briefly put an email to the project person how i what information would be helpful if she can get that would be great and uh i think by just being nice about it i got that information
don't have a specific instance that i can recall in which there were two people uh in a group uh who did not work well together people usually try to uh accommodate comprise with one another um people tend to be pretty mature about that um however on daily assignments um people tend to get overloaded with uh a lot of work you know the work ebbs and flows and when it slows i also get those two confused when it flows people can get a little stressed uh with each other on different sides of the project but um it's easy to get drawn into it because people complain to you about somebody else um but uh it's a dangerous um path to go down to get into uh supporting the arguments or getting involved in the arguments and bad mouthing somebody else so i guess it's just a question of um being understanding without being uh without agreeing with somebody understanding about somebody's position and how uh stressed they are without jumping onto the bandwagon about how it's somebody else's fault because it's always everybody's fault it's my fault it's your fault everybody has some fault or where everybody has the same stresses so the way that i try to get around that or to deal with that is to be uh empathetic i guess and to uh listen and uh roll my eyes about my own stresses and uh people seem to be uh willing to help out in those cases
uh i don't recall a specific instance of trying to gain someone's trust while negotiating with him but um it is often it often has happened in my job uh where i will be speaking with someone about um an article that i'm writing or speech or presentation and uh they may not be very comfortable with uh speaking to me or having their work discussed that way or more likely more often is um they want to present the story uh a particular aspect of the story and as it happens people here are involved in pretty highly technical work but uh my the communications that i write uh the audiences uh that i write for are non technical people and uh for communication to be effective and meaningful to a non technical audience it has to be accessible and it can't be written in a lot jargon and narrow angles so uh in a kind of a general sense um when someone wants to focus on technical or narrow aspects of uh a project i uh listen take notes ask questions and then try to steer the conversation back to what i think a more lay reader or audience would be most interested in but in the writing of it um give a little bit of everybody's side of the story something that's on the technical material um but introduce the story in a more lay approach that's going to be uh more accessible and have a broader appeal to uh non technical readers
this is such a common occurrence in my work that it's hard to pick out a specific instance but um i as a writer a writer of uh the communication but it's not my communication uh for instance uh in office where i could be writing uh either a speech or um a white paper written uh or a letter even and uh this is a large organization and uh one project could involve people from different parts of the company and everybody who is involved in the project has a stake in the outcome of the project but also in the communication and uh they should have a voice and everything else have a voice in the communication and uh i as  professional writer i think i um know how it should read i think that my style would be the best but um like i said everybody thinks that way but uh the fact is it's not my communication it's somebody else's or it's other people's and they have uh let's just say a legitimate interests but they have uh within their every right to expect to get their voice represented in the communication so i try to uhmanage my edits so and suggestions so that they are not overwhelming or uh stamp out somebody else's voice or view or uh uh interest and accommodate everybody give a little of this persons edits give a little of that persons edits don't completely rewrite the voice keep the voice because it's their voice not my voice uh but that's a constant negotiation that i do kind of quietly with myself as i go about my work i don't know if anybody would ever be able to detect it but um i'm assuming that um the final product satisfies everyone and meets their needs and they're happy with it i guess i've done my job well
uh i can recall an instance in which uh uh i was preparing i was assigned to write a uh white paper again of the board of trustees uh on behalf of different areas of the company and uh there was uh an interest uh among uh some people in having in addition to a white paper also having an executive summary of it as well as a powerpoint presentation uh as i got deeper into the project the assignment uh it became clear that there's is only so much time to get the material the assignment done uh and there would probably be time for an executive summary besides the or even more importantly the executive summary as i kind of started in on it would have uh been very repetitive because it wasn't that long a white paper twenty or thirty pages i guess if that much uh and a white paper or executive summary to a short paper it has to get redundant and uh not to add much value  and it was really just a question of uh pointing that out and uh to my supervisor and saying i've started on this and it's pretty clear that it's just going to be a lot of extra verbiage and a lot of repetitive material so maybe if it's not necessary he'll remove the executive summary we'll have an introduction which uh every white paper would have anyway but the introduction serves the same purpose as an executive summary if you can only read a couple of pages of a white paper the introduction should tell you everything that an executive summary would and uh that's how uh we approached it and it worked
i worked at several newspapers and uh uh there's always one or two editors who are difficult people um there's many that are great but um in one uh job i recall an editor uh who's an an attorney he's on a legal publication he's a lawyer by training came to journalism through that they really didn't have that great a feel for um investigative journalism type of approach and uh w-w- he would often insert very legalesey jargony type of language into a news article um and it just doesn't it just doesn't work it reads very inconvenient and very sound very stilted uh but i have found uh that when i i had found in those jobs and when i approached the article in a way that was most comfortable for me as the reporter on it um it would work best that way and there wouldn't be a lot of argument or any argument um if if something isn't written in a certain way then certain languages it's it's it's going to be obvious that it doesn't fit try not to get into arguments though with supervisors it's not a good idea
very rarely in any job i guess felt that i was given an unfair share of unpleasant tasks i guess every job has it's share of unpleasant or boring tasks uh so i've never really felt singled out that way and there are jobs or assignments that i don't enjoy doing and i dread getting uh when i was a newspaper reporter i would dread a lot of obituaries and call on a police departments and various you know couple of counties and ask them if they had any news for the day there was a lot of accidents and some things like that uh it's drudgery it's boring uh unpleasant especially if people don't really want to hear from you uh at another newspaper job uh it would often happened that a court decision would come down late in the week in the uh deadline cycle and of course it would be a seventy-five page opinion on insurance for appeals court which is about as mind crushing and denting is possible but it's got to go to somebody somebody has to write it uh which means somebody has to read it but uh oddly enough even that could be interesting uh reading that reasoning or research material here sometimes it's not the topic that i would gravitate to but the more you read about something the more interesting and the more engrossed you can get in it and uh that's just a part of the job and i can complain about assignments but uh never that i get more than my fair share of boring one it's just that's work and life
i really don't have any i don't recall any instance in which someone took over the leadership of a project and ignored the contributions that were not in accordance with his or her own opinion um people have come and gone with projects and people uh on projects uh often have different views um if uh it's i guess in those situations i need to remember i try to remember that uh ah it's usually not my it's not my communication here i'm working for someone else they have a right to their voice everybody has a right to be heard um and uh the trick in a work setting i guess in any other social setting too is being able to recognize or distinguish between what's important to you as for your ego uh why you would be holding on to a position is it for ego is it fear or uh is it a genuinely held position? it's not easy to do but um i think it's a helpful approach in trying to manage teams people on teams or your own my own role in a team my job i'm very often left alone i uh don't work in teams very often i work for groups of people with different uh uh constituencies they call there's other communication but uh i'm pretty much left to do the work on my own with other people's input but um it's how i would handle it
i can give this an instance a recent instance um and uh of listening skills i'd define it a little differently than listening with my ears um as a writer i write something a draft and it will be circulated among different stakeholders and they will respond ah usually on the draft and so different notes and suggestions and then just come back on the draft and some people are better than others at knowing not just what to say but how to say it in a way that's not going to antagonize work that's not going to antagonize me um very recently i got uh some uh edits or suggestions edits really comments on uh communication that it did press my buttons not because necessarily because of the substance although i had some dispute with that but um the form and how it was said style and that it really bothered me um the listening part entails reading or hearing or understanding the substance of the editor or the feedback ah separate from the tone or style of it we'll not always agree to that ah i've gotten more mindful about it and much better under the years but sometimes you know under a pressure situation um it can really just be quite annoying i can't say i um did not respond to that person directly i did to my supervisors and uh in a way that there was a substance of it in a way that produced substantive responses and a product ended up fine
in i haven't really had any occasion i can recall to uh be critical of my supervisor i'm very fortunate in  having pretty good supervisors uh but uh the nature of my work 'editing' is uh criticism is kind of inherent in it if somebody used me to draft they've written and wanted and they want it edited i'm going to edit and i can be an aggressive editor uh this happens almost everyday uh and the way that i approach that is we use the track changes and if we ever had a draft that's marked up with a lot of track changes you open it up it looks like it's been painted red and it can be pretty unsettling and jawing and pretty annoying uh but i try to limit my edits to what i think is most important most substantive but also what's going to improve the readability of it uh and certainly not to explain when i think explanations are necessary uh not to just rewrite it but also it was very important to provide that person the writer with two versions  say a version showing the edits or the track changes which you can induce a heart attack when you open it up and one showing with the edits accepted it's a clean version so uh it's much easier to read without the distractions of the edits and without the kind of emotional content of seeing all the uh edits and i find that i think it seems to help uh because it's easy to read and you can see the uh improvements or things that you don't want to accept if you're the uh uh client i guess and it's also important to tell people that to make the point that these are suggestions uh through communication
translating complex and technical material to non technical uh audiences that's everyday on my job i'm the uh go-between between uh technical people who are creating projects or conducting research uh and readers who uh are not familiar at all with their material are not familiar with the language and nomenclature um and uh often i'm the one who's not familiar with it but um i did my best to learn about the uh material so i have a grasp of it and sometimes that involves speaking with a technical person or sometimes it just means uh reading about it and uh my responsibility is to reduce it to its most interesting meaningful and accessible uh language and presentation um while fairly and accurately fully representing the uh whatever is innovative unique or um and very unique about the product um every almost every script i write for an all staff meeting uh will uh try to explain a new product or a new assessment uh in uh very brief terms there's not a lot of time to explain it and uh to use as little jargon and as few acronyms as possible it's easy to do when you're writer to identify with the technical people because you learn about an issue and you get comfortable with uh acronyms it's a way to speak to the technical people but uh when you're writing it you will need to know how to translate that for so it will be a meaningful communication to everyone else
well uh we have actually have a current work situation in which this question perfectly describes what i'm trying to do uh the background of this situation is uh for several years i've been the person who is in charge of distributing the proper amount of tape recorders and headsets and assorted gear that we need at the ap reading in the second session of cincinnati two uh at cincinnati two we do the uh subjects that require uh tapes music and the four languages spanish french german and italian i have was told that i'm going to now move on to some other projects and praxis not ap and we're transitioning another person is basically now going to be the leader or is going to be responsible for all of this here's what i've tried to do basically i show him what to do and he shadows what i do so my behavior is to without being overbearing about it suggest certain ways to do this um and since i'm still going to be using these in cincinnati two i am packing my own parachute so i demonstrate how we get the pilots how we unpack them test everything and then redistribute the equipment according to the various subjects needs spanish is the largest they get the most they got the most varied and right now it's going along quite smoothly and we're moving at nice clip so i'm hoping that will continue thank you
this is a tougher question because i don't have uh subordinates uh i am what i call a utility in fielder or a grunt uh when it comes to working everything that is i know a little about everything but not a lot about just one thing uh for me to build motivation in co workers uh this would have to be an everyday situation in what i do at work and that is again providing modeling through my behavior to other people to my co workers i fill pre work work on time i'm there all the time i ask the questions that need to be asked i'm not afraid of asking for help or by my actions telling somebody that they know more than i do and then i'm also willing to learn and then work with that person to get a particular task and so again as i responded earlier my behavior is to act uh responsibly uh whole heartedly and openly and by providing this example get people also to to work with me and if that comes close to building motivation then yes this is what i do but as a general rule like i said i am not in any type of boss position uh and i don't like giving people orders per se because i never fell into the habit of i'd rather show them what to do through example than actually say okay this is what i want you to do i do it and show them what needs to be done and hopefully that builds motivation thank you
this is more theoretical because i can't recall off the top of my head any time i did this uh i do work with people who obviously don't work well together sometimes uh occasionally i don't particularly feel like working well together with me uh what i do in that situation is basically i accept blame i have a self deprecating sense of humor i will be the one who if something goes wrong and they are just ready to blame anybody i'll accept the blame it's really hard what i've discovered is when people expect you to fight back and you don't this is very disconcerting to them and they have to it forces them into the position of being the nicer guy i mean this is the guy who has just confessed to being an idiot oh jeez it was my fault uh um i'm really sorry how do you suggest we do this? you give them the feeling of responsibility of accomplishment and you they unwittingly become your ally you do this not by conflict you do this not by saying well i'm the boss and this is what you're going to do uh i modify my own behavior in the hope that this puts them in a different mode they don't have to like me but it's really hard when somebody has told you know that more than he does to be mad at because this is what you think of yourself anyway in that position and again generally these are short term things they work out thank you
i remember a time it was working at an ap reading in kentucky and i was new and i was trying to fit in uh working with and trying to gain trust so i could ask these people what needed to be done to negotiate with them to find out uh where i could fit in best with the group and how we could work well together uh one of the ways i did that was through establishing common ground through conversations general probing find out what you have in common and build on that in fact not only what the two of you have in common but what that person and the other person across the room has in common and talk to that person and mention that people love to talk about their common interests it just breaks down so many barriers that way it's an informal way for doing it but like i said i generally work through an informal method so you talk to people you listen to them you find out what's in common and you also bring that commonality to somebody else and you create a bridge between those people and a third and yourself and suddenly you have a group that is gently surprised with uh what they have in common with the other people working from that background then you can move into the business aspects and then it becomes a little bit more formalized but people are then more ready to share more ready to be open more ready for a more harmonious outcome in the workplace and in kentucky we got the job done thank you
well recently uh a colleague and i were asked to come up with a powerpoint presentation uh for a praxis meeting the subject was how best to use small groups of scores to work more effectively uh on prompts by splitting them up into teams so instead of having the traditional one group goes into calibration then into scoring then goes to another question is to split it up so that you would have two groups concurrently in two different uh or even three different prompt eliminating the waiting time and then showing how this saves you time and money she didn't want to do uh we were told to do this and she just she says i know what to do but i don't know how to explain it i really i don't want to do it uh so what i did this is bargaining this compromising was okay i said you're the expert in the actual process but i know powerpoint i know editing and i know presentation so we'll split it up to fit our mutual strengths uh this led to her saying okay and just giving me just a bunch of notes to work with and i did a little interviewing as well put it into a powerpoint presentation it had sixteen iterations she liked it and she actually was the one who she liked it so much it was so much comfortable she ended up doing the presentation it was quite
i create metrics documentation that my team uses to record our progress uh week by week month by month and so on unfortunately a couple of my peers aren't very good at keeping up with their documentation and their recording my supervisor has asked me to work with them in a quasi supervisal position to guide them and mentor them in improving their skills however i'm not officially their supervisor but i do work with them to give them tips and provide some background about what works for me what hasn't worked for me and to guide them towards improving their performance
i'm the first one in my team to obtain my green belt my two coworkers are currently completing theirs and i've assisted both of them on their projects reviewing data reviewing slides and giving them um encouragement tips and so on they are both almost done i've recently reviewed uh the ones last set of slides before she meets with the corporate master black belt and was telling her everything that she did was absolutely right it's the same thing i would have done and i thought her data looked wonderful she felt relieved and much more calm than she had before we talked about her project and she's meeting with him today so we'll see what the final outcome was but it seemed positive and uh the encouragement seemed to make both partners feel better
when i was teaching i had two classroom assistants who didn't get along with each other well and what i tried to do the most was assign them things to do within the classroom where they weren't interacting assign somebody to work with a group of students and somebody else to work with papers or things along those lines i did talk to both of them separately and tried to work with them that way and uh the outcome was mixed they attempted to work together uh clearly didn't get along but were able to perform what they needed to perform during the day uh without too much conflict
well i think my initial job interview for this position was a negotiation and that's the time that you're trying to gain trust um what i tend to do that i think works well in these situations or in situations with coworkers where you are given a project and you may not know the person well or may not get along with them well if you do is try to personalize things to find something that you have in common that you can talk about whether it's work related or outside of work but by personalizing your situation and finding things that are in common it tends to put them at ease and uh lighten up the situation and they do tend to open up to you a bit more um especially asking people questions about themselves and their interests and giving them an opportunity to speak and you listen that usually provides a positive outcome and yields the results that at least i would want um in that type of situation and i tend to be successful with that method
well bargaining is a big part of what i do in my position i'm a liaison between the it department and the office of quality um working on documentation and many people have other things deadlines they need to do and don't consider this the most important or top priority for their uh day to day work however the office of quality sees it differently and expects things in a timely manner and it's my job to work between the two sides and help move things along so many times what i'll do with document owners and people that have things they need to move with and the tool is i will lay everything out for them and offer to do as much as the lab work for them as possible i do the formatting of their documents and create cover pages and the things i need to do to make life easy for them so that they can do as minimal amount of work towards this as possible and not interrupt their regular work as much as possible the outcome turns to be extremely favorable people appreciate my willingness to help them and to make things easier for them and it gets me very positive results with getting things accomplished in a timely manner
well this situation just came up recently i've been working for the past two years or so with somebody at a monthly report who's a bit difficult to work with in that uh they are not very good at following through on their data things are often incorrect or late and so what i wanted to do was create a share point site where everything was centralized and visible to all parties to hold the person a bit more accountable and to avoid or reduce the uh volume of email stack and forth then having to go back and search for things so the person was a bit resistant to it and we had a meeting with the two of us with their supervisor and some other stakeholders that were involved in the process we talked about what the goal was what my vision was and how it would improve things and after some discussion and a bit of objection from this person i was able to create the site we've just launched it so it's been too soon to say what the exact outcome is but it looks like it's an improvement it looks like it'll make things better and clear i was able to send the um updated report out to this person and to a director that the report ultimately is done for and give them each a list of the action items they needed to respond to and it was all in one place whether that's in screen shots and links and uh other emails so i think it's going to be a positive outcome
well this question piggy backs right on the last one uh to the same person and over the last couple of years we've had a difficult time working together she is often uh late with responding her data is incomplete or incorrect and i spend a lot of time going back and looking for the correct information making updates going back and asking her to make updates and she gets extremely defensive and argumentative about having to go back and redo her work so we started out having a meeting with her manager and another manager in the group and uh it was semi-successful for a short time and then things reverted back to what they were her manager had suggested that i copy her on emails and that improved the situation greatly i was getting immediate responses things were done accurately and that was wonderful while it was going on as soon as that stopped things went right back to the way they were and so as i said in the previous question we recently met and my suggestion was to create the share point site to cut down on some of the back and forth of emails and create more visibility across the board for all parties that are involved and so on and i do think that this is going to be a positive outcome and a big improvement on what the situation has been
well i can't think of any particularly unpleasant tasks tedious boring or demanding that i've been asked to do um that's more than my share i think sometimes i'm asked to do more than my share of documentation as far as in our lead capacity when i'm not officially a lead and that can be a little bit tedious having to update templates for the team um over and over again and if things like that when i've got other work that needs to get done that has deadlines that can be a little bit overwhelming basically the work needs to get done whether i'm happy with it or i agree with it or not so i've done and i'm lucky enough that i report to somebody that i can speak frankly to so basically i just vent i'm a venter and i've explained how i felt and we've talked about it and it's just one of those situations things come up that you don't necessarily like everything you do but that's what you are there for and that's what you have to do so you get it done and you move on
about a year or so ago i was in a root cause analysis training analysis training and we were put into groups they were assigned so it wasn't a group of people that i would have necessarily chosen for myself and we did have somebody that saw themselves as the group leader and the expert who tended to take over the projects and answer the questions for the group without necessarily including everybody's opinion um what i tried to do was interject my opinion as much as possible within the group to get answers that were included before the end of the project if i wasn't successful in that sometimes i was sometimes i wasn't so if i wasn't successful in that then i did my best to answer questions individually as they were asked of people in the group to make sure that my thoughts were recognized as uh part of the class to the trainers
well there's a couple of different types of communication problems that come into play with my role one is that i deal with people from other countries that have very strong accents and many times it's hard to understand them i did have a situation with one in particular that the accent was so strong and after asking him to repeat something several times to the point that it would have become annoying to him for me to continue to ask i had to ask him to send me his requests in email because i was not able to understand once he sent things to me in email i was able to understand what he was asking and take care of his needs without any other problems the other type of communication problem that comes into play is working with somebody where you may hear things differently somebody can tell you something and one person hears one thing and somebody else hears another and i find if i run into something like that the best thing to do is to talk to the parties involved and relate what i think i heard or what i think i was told and confirm from them that that is in fact what i heard or that it wasn't and they can correct me and we can move on from that situation and that's usually the best way to handle communication problems if you just make assumptions and you don't say anything that can lead to bigger problems down the road
well this has happened a couple of times and as i said earlier i'm lucky enough that i'm able to speak frankly to my supervisor and so when something has happened that i felt was inappropriate or not the right way to handle something i'm able to go to her and just tell her frankly i didn't feel that was appropriate for that time or i didn't like whatever the situation was and we'll talk about what was going on at that point and time what her thoughts were why something happened if necessary she'll apologize and we'll move on from it uh recently we had a larger incident that i felt was more serious and so i sent an email to her and a copied her manager and laid out exactly what happened and how i felt about it and we scheduled a meeting for the three of us to get together and sit and talk about things and it was extremely productive we cleared the air about many issues and talked about some future goals and the outcome was extremely positive we've got a very open honest favorable relationship and i felt that it was necessary and if i hadn't done things the way that i did them things might be strained between us
well i was working on my green belt my higher supervisor asked me to give a presentation to our team about my project and how it was progressing and some other things related to the project many of the people in my group have not had six sigma training and aren't familiar with the tools or the charts or the language and so when i gave the presentation i wanted to ensure that they were understanding what i was explaining and what i did is i broke things down into more plain english or if i had to use jargon i gave the definition and explained what i was talking about as i went along to make the controlled charts and other things they were looking at easy to understand and more relatable to what they are doing and not at a higher removed level from them the outcome was extremely positive i had many people thank me for speaking in english as they put it and making that presentation interesting and understandable and so that they could follow what i was talking about and i appreciated that feedback from them as well
um recently there was an issue in sws hr where uh when on boarding new hires we had to manually input their new hire information into the system and uh there were a lot of errors and they wanted to get it down to zero errors uh there's a couple of us that sat on the front line so we were all responsible and charged with the task of uh manually entering the new hire information so that means that the errors could be have been spread amongst all of us uh but because they wanted zero errors i underwent the task of uh making some suggestions i even went to the extent of uh taking the statement class to help me be able to analyze the information uh to get into a solution a solid solution on how to eliminate the errors uh during that time we also went through a phase where there was a new program um a revamped new hire program where the new hire actually inputed their own information um so they kind of skewed the data points and i had to reposition um reanalyze the data to get to another solution or to see if that was the solution for the problem and we had a couple of meetings i actually led a couple of meetings to get people's take or feel why they would be making errors versus why the new hires would be making an error it turned out that we significantly reduced the amount of errors uh and so at this point right now all i have to do is the final part of my uh six sigma projects go ahead and be certified but that the problem was resolved successfully
well i actually don't have any subordinates uh never have and actually i don't want any um i'm individual contributor so it kind of works out pretty well uh motivating coworkers is something that i think that everybody needs motivation and a lot of times uh we're all plagued in that area in each specific area we're plagued with the same dilemmas or drama that uh you know unless you talk about it to someone in your area no one would really understand so it's pretty easy to listen to what's is going on plus that is a part of my job to listen to what is going on to take the temperature of our group uh and to just kind of ease them or play as a mediator for different issues that might arise and tension uh but i find that most of the times just listening uh to people really helps and offering solutions that maybe perhaps they didn't take into consideration if there is something that i could help to remedy
uh that's a pretty good question when you're in a situation where you are a part of a team and you have two members that don't work well together and honestly it happened very frequently especially um in certain areas here in ets um so it's not something it's not a situation that i'm totally unfamiliar with um typically i just get to the bottom line of it um i can approach a business situation very professionally so um it helps that i'm able to remove the emotion from both sides and act as a translator so i'll hear what one side is actually saying so that i can get what the business question actually is in order to respond successfully um and i think that people appreciate the fact that i could remove or can remove emotion from otherwise emotional situations um i just kind of remain calm um  and i find that being calm in a situation where people really don't get along and they have to work together uh being calm has to help everybody else to get calm identify what it is that their charged with doing and then just get on with it professionally with uh efficient whatever outcome it is so i think it kind of works out most of the time you see those people typically they just stay away from each other unless they absolutely have to which is weird because i actually have a boss who encourages everybody to have tea when there is an issue you know go and have coffee or tea together or something like that but that's not really uh my approach to it and i'm not seeing where that works going to have coffee with people so you know you just stay in get to the core of it and try to solve it and move on
this question kind of ties into the last question because a lot of times when you find that people aren't working well together it has something to do with trust um i recently was promoted into the role that i'm in so um trying to gain trust in an environment that is otherwise set up immediately to be distrusting is a odd place to be uh so i just kind of really try and focus uh right now i've been charged with cleaning up the budget there was a lot of issues um a lot of things happened that should not have happened in the past and so i have to clean up the budget i have to find where money went why money was not properly allocated um why money might have been hidden in weird lines um which is automatically uh not a trusting environment especially when you dealing with money but to have to be the one to bear that news and actually find and know where things happened um is a challenge because you have to tell people that they were wrong uh and it's a fine line between being able to solidly say you were wrong and have the data to back it up versus just running around accusing people so i really do focus on data um anything or anything that i say i make sure that i back it up with data again i don't i remove i try to remove the emotion from it because that not what i'm here i'm not here to accuse anyone you know i just want to simply clear the air state the facts and show what happened um i think my group pretty much gets about me now not for the gossip i don't have the time for it i don't want to be bothered with it i find that its too much to keep up with anyway so i think its pretty easy for me to get the trust of my peers and coworkers and colleagues i've been successful so far
there was a company that uh hired me for a dream job that actually did not exist and uh once i was in the role i discovered that they had these little random odd inequities and rules that um were really antiquated they were so outdated it was like from the stone age when people were running around with no pants tit was those kinds of rules um and i would try to bargain i called it bartering certain pieces of the role that i really did not want to be bothered with and i would take on other parts of other people roles that they really didn't want be bothered with and it worked out just fine until the supervisor caught wind of it and uh she came up with a rule that they is not going to be more bartering but i think that was pretty successful because i managed to do that for uh probably over a year to actually carve out a dream job in a situation where i otherwise i had been intending to leave and did uh plan to leave uh but subsequently the environment changed a bit so there was some leeway but i'm pretty good at negotiating it's got me this far
um i'm pretty good at persuasion um bargaining bartering so um one example is um we were assigned phone duties so they have a receptionist and um we have to cover her phones we would have to cover her phones and it would be supposed to be fifteen minutes in the morning the lunch break and fifteen minutes in the afternoon um but this particular receptionist was known to abuse that so she literally would say oh i have to run and do this and be gone for like hours which means not only are you doing your job but you are doing her job which is covering the phones and most of the phone calls that were coming on that line which is supposed to be a main line were personal calls so um in one of our group meetings i brought it up because i had gotten tired of everyone coming to me individually with the same complaint and it was a complaint that i also had um but it was like these private conversations that everyone was having with only me so it wasn't something that anyone was willing to escalate higher so that it could be resolved of course i was so i brought it up in a meeting and i got people to admit that they had those conversations with me um the outcome was that we all kept logs started to keep logs of how many hours over the course of the day we wound up with the phones um and so i don't know how it was ultimately resolved with the receptionist but i know for us it became easier um she was assigned a fifteen minutes break and that was it fifteen minutes here fifteen minutes there was the dedicated time so that everybody could do their own work um instead of being overwhelmed with the phones it's one of those antiquated practices of having a dedicated receptionist with no solid back up she was not even allowed to have even voice mail so it was like weird
i have been in a situation where actually frequent more time than not there is someone that i'm not especially fond of not because i don't like like them because i'm not especially fond of and not necessary dislike them all around it could be because i don't like them professionally but i thought that they were nice person it could be that i didn't think they were a nice person but they were really were good professionals uh and recently i had someone that i actually reported to uh that i just like professionally did not get along with uh it's kind of difficult to be charged with a task and no a clear path of achieving successfully all of the objectives everything that have been said before but we have someone who does not necessarily know the job and that's the person that you have to report to uh you know get a satisfactory outcome or get a agreement that that outcome is satisfactory uh this is really tricky is very tricky so last year i had a schedule uh i scheduled over three hundreds interviews uh for the year which is pretty challenging especially given how some of the panels are set up and the way that was worked out was that she didn't interfere with what it is that i had to do and she just focused on the data that i had sent her so i was able to send her list to show all of the interviews that you know she is not aware of how scheduling went so i didn't need her input or her design or her model of how to interview schedule the interviews uh and we were pretty successful uh ad actually on-boarded quite a few people and it was because of a lot of things that i had done to get all of their candidates in without interruptions to most people's schedules
uh with the scheduling at interviews it's not necessarily unpleasant it's not tedious it's not boring it's not physically demanding but it requires no brain skills so um it's easy to get into but and just not want to do it um across the board we all were charged we had all these groups that we had to schedule for some groups had more scheduling than the others so i was always assigned to the heaviest group and it was just strange because every few months i would get a new group and the new group that i got had to have heaviest volume that they had ever experience in the year so within an year i was able to get almost all of the groups who had the heaviest volume at some point in time and when the volume go down i would get assigned in another group which it was a job it wasn't my favorite part of the job but it was the job and it was a job that everyone had to do um and i found that a lot of the other admins would complain and use the word 'overwhelmed' um and so as a way to a make it so that they feel overwhelmed i had to supervisor who would come to me and say can you help such and such because she is overwhelmed but she didn't take it into consideration that at the time i had the heaviest volume and the way i handled that was just to simply say no and i was okay with that um the outcome to me was successful if worse than to find alternatives or deal with the fact that they were charged with the same task that i was charged with and to handle it professionally in a way that they needed to and to get their job done but i'm pretty okay with saying no as well so you know most people don't like hearing 'no' but um because i'm blunt about things so when they hear a no from me they know it's not emotions it's just is basically what it is it is
i've never really encountered this type of situations so i can't really answer this one uh where people ignore contributions it's not a safe route to take and i think that most managers who are managers and are able to maintain their position as managers know that is poor form and it will not lead to successful um work environment you wont get very far ignoring contributions that they might not try and make a big 'hoopla' about peoples contributions and they might minimize them but i don't know about the blatant just ignoring them so i cant really that would be really weird uh i haven't encountered that at any company that i've worked for that will be kind of awkward especially if you are in a position when you are managing strategic teams and you have to keep cycling out for different teams for different projects that's really a poor form
uh this question is kind of i guess a double edged sword i came from a very heavily driven sop environment so um communication was probably sop and operation was is still highly successful so in that sense i didn't have to overcome any communication problems um and i don't think i have ever felt like there was a communication problem as it was pertains to me i can see communications problems as it pertains to other people but that's just because of again distrusting environment uh and i think i'm pretty much still working through that because again i'm still within the roles and i don't know i'm still trying to figure out how to get people to effectively communicate with each other especially if there is a pair that just really just don't talk at all and i think that one feels threatened any other who was just promoted as well feels challenged and it's just like oil and vinegar so i'm still kind of working through that on how to get them to successfully communicate on things that they have to and i think that is where the issue it is for me i don't think they will ever just be pals sit around talking but it's kind of tricky still kind of trying to figure that one out myself
i think this questions come from like little snapshot in my new role because uh again i have been charged with the task of communicating difficult information on a daily sometimes basis um i just kind of rely on the data so if i have to say that something happened or something occurred i always make sure that i have data to back it up um my introduction to that was there is this naughty list uh that the officers go on for auto approved time and um uh the officer that i support just lived on that list his name was always on that list every week week after week after week and it's a part of the officers objectives not to be on this list or to significantly reduce their presence on this list and up until this point i had not involved into actually approving time and i was charged with the task of ensuring that that number drops significantly so for a few months i was able to get him off of the list uh and it was a challenge with an ed who always said i approve the time but she never had the data that she approved the time uh but because i'm data driven i know that you can track anything and everything so i would always i always its a secret i don't tell anyone but i always track the time that i approve and i do that by taking screen shots uh so that if there is an issue and he does need the list i have sheen shots that shows this person never appeared on my list uh it's successful and he's pleased and it's actually good the whole team including that particular ed is pleased because now she doesn't have to worry about every week having the conversation with the officer about no approving time so the issue is resolved there's some nuances there but that's when new members are added to the team
um for me i have never encountered this issue for me it would be the reverse um i was always groomed that in order to be successful at communicating you had to communicate i think for me um when i first learned how to speak to people it was like you had to talk to people as though they only had a seventh grade education and nothing here at ets it's reversed i don't think people here um were taught that so well i've never had this issue of explaining a complex or technical idea to someone that's not technical unfamiliar i think that a lot of people would do well to answer this question here at ets because i'll find that when they talk about things they use a lot of not only do they use a lot of words many words to say what they need to say but they use words that are not necessary they use complex words to talk about average things so i have never encountered this problem
a few years ago i was working in a retail situation and the human resource director on the property um really kind of just morphed into that role didn't have a human resource background and didn't really have any formal training in human resources or training um she was getting very backed up in trying to reach the corporate goals for training for the staff at the store and although that wasn't my position um and i was in no way a formal leader in regard to that i kind of took the lead in helping her to understand how to motivate the staff to pursue the training that they needed not only for their benefit but for the benefit of the whole company um i've also mentored and coached her on different techniques she could use in reaching the employees in getting them excited and motivated to complete the training um it was very fulfilling to me to be able to help her and to try to do it in such a way as to not step on her toes or impose on her position um but just to not only help the company help the staff but help her to be better in what it was they wanted her to do
when i was working at the new jersey division of taxation there was a major culture shift going on um in regard to computer usage we had a lot of older employees who didn't really have a lot of computer experience the organization was moving in the direction where auditors and investigators were expected to prepare correspondence for themselves using word processors uh create spreadsheets and generally use the microsoft suite of products um they were budget constraints at the time so the concept of sending all the staff out for training wasn't reasonable so they decided to open an in house training center uh which was called the reach center and the reach center was designed to train these employees on how to use a windows based computer um there was a lot of push back from some of the older workers who really didn't feel like they were at a point in their life where they wanted to learn something new  the uh coworkers that i had that i was working with on the project some of them were a little uncomfortable with trying to push people what they felt was push people into the direction of computers um but i was able to create a very fun enjoyable atmosphere where not only my coworkers but my subordinates and that the trainees all felt validated they felt important they felt like they were learning things um and the outcome was that we ended up creating a wonderful computer training lab where the courses that we offered became so sought after that people from other departments and divisions were requesting to come into the division of taxation and have training done there um so it was really it was a wonderful experience for everybody involved and a lot of the old timers really fell in love with the computer
it is a very difficult situation whenever your leading a group or working with a group where not everybody can get along uh we did have some instances in the reach center where some of the employees didn't exactly care for each other on a personal level the way that i handled that situation was first and foremost i did a lot of team building activities and a lot of coaching and mentoring and trying to encourage each other to look for the best in their coworkers and look at each other strengths and try to downplay their weaknesses and especially take note of the areas where you have a strength where somebody else doesn't and perhaps you can back them up or help them in that area and help them grow that strength too um as much as possible where it was reasonable and detrimental to the program i allowed those individuals to work on separate parts of the program independently so there wasn't so much uh constant contact between them until they got to the point where they could begin to respect each other strengths and each others contributions to the situation it's not always easy to handle that and it's not always easy to get past it sometimes you have to remove somebody from the group sometimes it helps to add a third person to the group to kind of mitigate some of that tension between the first two so in my case i was able to just really keep pushing the team building aspect until we got to the point after a few uh months of having a really strong team and it goes through that whole uh you know forming storming norming performing situation you have with any team and once they got past that storming stage they were able to normalize and really perform at amazing levels
um any time you start to work in a new area with a new company on a new project you always have to go through a period of trying to establish your trustworthiness and gaining trust with the people that you're going to work with uh that can be particularly difficult if you come into a project or something where there's a sense or urgency and things have to move quickly i was the project manager at a marketing firm for an interactive silo of the company and there was there were some people in the traditional silo who were really reluctant to engage and buy into the whole idea of interactive marketing so it was a very uh urgent need to gain their trust quickly and to have them understand the importance of the direction that we were moving in with the company as a whole and the way that i did that the way that i was able to gain their trust was one by genuinely caring uh about them as people about their projects about looking for ways to incorporate and not eliminate the things that they had done traditionally um and by removing that idea from them that somehow the interactive direction of the company was going to eliminate the need for the more traditional pieces we were able to gain their trust and start to have them see where the internet is really just the hub of activity and all the other traditional pieces still come into play and now with the use of the internet we can track the success of those other tactics uh and the outcome was that the company really started to explode in the interactive space and start to get some real traction from their interactive products
so one time i was working on this really large website redesigne um for a company and the stakeholders at the company we were doing the work for were very slow in returning responses and to getting us the information that we needed to complete the project as a result our um deadline was not going to be made for the launch of the project and originally the customer or the client just wanted me to have my staff work basically around the clock to try to still deliver on the original date regardless of the fact that they missed every deadline that they had um in that situation yes clearly the client was wrong yes clearly it was the clients fault that the project wasn't going to launch successfully in a timely fashion but it's never good business to disappoint a client so what i was able to do was to negotiate and to work with the client and pick the most important parts of the launch do a soft launch on the date that we were supposed to originally launch and then follow that up with a full launch about two weeks later um so the client was extremely happy the features and the changes to the web redesign were included that the features and the changes that were most important to the client were included in the soft launch and some of the other features and some of the other enhancements which weren't as important to the client were held of and put out with the full launch um like i said about two weeks later so ultimately you ended up with everybody being very happy the employees were happy that they didn't have to sacrifice their lives for the next um couple of weeks and trying to meet an unreasonable deadline and the client was happy because they got what they really wanted in a timely fashion
while i was working in the field of marketing um a great portion of my responsibility was just that uh persuading people persuading clients to accept the proposals that wee had put together for them  um the client that i just spoke of with the really big website redesign and feature enhancement was one of those such cases they had had a pretty stagnant web design for a years they felt that it was doing the job for them um however based on statistical information based on user trends based on trends in the fashion industry on-line we were able to successfully convince the client that they really were missing out on a great deal of their market share because they weren't really marketing to their true clients anymore um they were marketing to the clients and the customers that they thought they had as opposed to really marketing to the customers that they had and um it's not uncommon for businesses to get into that situation where whom they think is their customer is not really accurately who is their customer um so and the only way that you can convince people differently of that is to show them cold hard facts to show them statistical data to show them numbers to show them um roi figures and things that are going to have value to them and we were able to successfully turn this client's website into a hub of information and interactive feature for their true customers the customers who were seeking them out and looking for them on a regular basis in the end the customer uh the client was extremely happy with the outcome and had won some awards based on the new design
um quite a few years ago i worked with a woman who actually was my supervisor at the time and she really was not a people person she had a very difficult time communicating she was the type of person that you would be working at your desk and if she had something to say to you rather than come over and say it she would write it on like a post-it note and stick it on your computer screen in front of your face where you were sitting there um and at first i was very uncomfortable with the situation and i struggled with it a little bit in the beginning but then what i did is i kind of refocused myself on two things one is i was there to do a job and so i put all my focus on my work and getting my job done and the other thing was i came to the realization that if you get to know anybody well enough you can understand why they are the way they are and that doesn't necessarily excuse behavior or change behavior or make behavior ah more acceptable but it does take any personal sting away from their behavior and so little by little more and more i got to know this woman and got to know of her own personal struggles i was able to separate um anything i was feeling personally about her behavior and just understand that she's just a product of her own environment and that there were external things and internal things going on within her that caused this behavior um i ended up working with her for years fine and we just never became best of friends but we were able to successfully get the work done that needed to get done
um i have to say this is kind of a tough question for me to answer because i don't think that i've ever really been in a situation where i felt that i was being given more than my share of unpleasant tasks and so perhaps that's just evidence that i never had that bad of a manager um or i'm just fortunate what i can say is how i think i would handle it if that situation came up um if i was ever in a situation where i thought that i felt like i was being kind of dumped on with the garbage work uh i would hope that my first response would be to go talk with to my manager or supervisor and ask them their thoughts on it and why you know they felt it was appropriate that i was getting all this work and that it wasn't being shared among the employees um because quite frankly without knowing the facts there might be a reason why the manager is giving you more of that to do than somebody else so um i can't say for sure because i've never been in that situation but i do hope that i would at least have enough respect for my manager or supervisor to go discus it with them first and then if there wasn't really a valid or a substantial reason for them giving me all that work um hopefully maybe i'd be able to work it out with them or negotiate with them to try and find a more equitable way to distribute the workload
so i've only been in a situation once in my life where i was the part of a group project and the leader of the project was totally marching to the beat of his own drum and cared little for what anybody else had to contribute um and basically had the end figured out before the project even started at in this situation it was a community group i was working with it was a community where i'm not a resident of that community but we had business connections in the community and that's why i was asked to serve on this committee um unfortunately for me personally this particular committee was so um was being so manipulated politically by the powers that be within the local government and like i mentioned it was clear that there was no real intention of ever um getting consensus for anything there was no real intention of ever considering anybody else's ideas or um suggestions that because it was because the committee was not my local committee because i was volunteering on it because i was giving up a lot of my time and seeing no true genuine um working together i just decided to step down from the committee in that particular case and you know the committee does still exist and they are still moving forward with their predesignated plans um but it has gotten more and more narrowly focused on members of the political group that was that were behind the forming of the committee to start with so that's where that's at right now
good old listening skills um on of my favorite lines to people is god gave you two ears and one mouth for a reason use them proportionately so uh listening skills are extremely important in life in general but especially at work and i did have a situation a few years ago where somebody had sent an email and basically it was a very angry email and really defined everything that person was not going to do in conjunction with a project that we had going on um so rather than take it at face value and rather than just accept that this person sent this email i went over and sat down and had a meeting with them and got into a conversation with them about why they felt the way they did about the tasks and the items that they were supposed to be working on this project and after spending some time with the person and listening it turned out that it was all a matter of miscommunication um the young lady involved was given the wrong due dates for projects due dates that were unrealistic and were um she didn't want to set herself up for failure and i understand that so once we were able to sit down and i heard where her concerns were and i went back and got the accurate information and share that with her um we were able to overcome this problem and she was more than happy to work on the project and she actually did a wonderful job with it
so one of the toughest situations i've ever been in was a few years ago when i was working in a pretty good size office and uh some rumors and suspicions started about romantic involvement between the chief of my department and my direct supervisor uh i don't know whether or not they were true it's not my problem not my business however the rumors were really causing  a lot of difficulty in the office uh they were causing a lot of difficulty for our department as a whole it was causing a lot of difficulty to the little divisions or sections within our department because this gentleman was a department head this woman was a division head uh and the other division heads were feeling uh resentful and like they were not getting the priority and the treatment that they deserved uh it was like the constant subject of conversation in the workplace and quite frankly i went into had a meeting with not only my supervisor but with the chief of the department and just told them both this is what is being said this is the effect that it's having on the department and you know at first the chief was very angry uh really felt that it was none of anybody's business uh however i was able to convey to him the fact that true or not you know uh if people thought it was true and it was impacting their work-life that he had an obligation to rectify the situation however he saw fit and that perception was reality to those who perceived it so he needed to change their perception if he wanted to change their reality and eventually uh he did focus more attention on the other divisions and
since i am a classroom instructor and trainer i've spent a lot of time in my life explaining complex and technical ideas to non technical people um especially like i said back when we started the computer center and so many of our auditors and investigators really had no computer experience whatsoever um two things that i find the most beneficial when i'm doing this is one to take every um complex idea or technical task and break it done into small um digestible chunks and the other thing i do is i work a lot with analogies because when you can create a parallel in somebody's mind between what they're doing um why they're doing it and something they're familiar with doing it helps to bridge that gap and cut that learning curve um substantially back when i was teaching people computers early on when they really didn't know much about computers i was able to use a lot of analogies about um file storage rooms and file cabinets and filing draws and folders within those draws and using those um material things that they were used to working with on a regular basis i was able to um help them to transfer that knowledge to the file tree in their computer system and help them to really get an idea of understanding how things are stored on their hard drive and how they have the flexibility to add another file room add another file cabinet just add a drawer into an existing file cabinet just add some folders into a drawer that's already working well for them um so for me it's never been difficult to do this it's something that just comes naturally to me it's all about small pieces and familiarity
a work situation where i was not the formal leader uh is with the quality team that i work with here in the quality excellence department of the office of quality uh there are probably six quality engineers uh one of which is a senior quality engineer and two of which are quality managers the background is that we were all tasked about reading a book uh about strength binders and then we had to take uh some kind of quiz and it resulted in analysis about what our strengths were on strategy on uh a couple of different four different dimensions and the task uh from our executive director was to put together a presentation so the behavior that i carried out in response so when the team gets together there are a number of different ideas and personalities but in an attempt to get to uh the final work product which was the presentation i did take a leadership sort of task and initiative to sort of guide the discussion make sure that we stayed on task uh and ensure that our work product uh was one it met the objectives uh that in terms of the powerpoint presentation that it was you know quality and something that we could present to both the vice president and to the team the outcome was a success i was able to uh not only guide the conversation but as well do the powerpoint slide and then revise it as needed to make sure it was coherent once all of the other quality engineers gave their input
i was able to build um motivation um with an ivec intern that joined the office of quality this past summer um she was from princeton university she was in operations um and um i was her mentor for the summer the behaviors that i carried out is coming in this is my first time being a mentor this is her first time interning here at ets i wanted to talk to her about what her goals were make sure that there were clear and defined objectives for the projects and for the ten weeks summer and um so i would meet with her on a weekly basis just to make sure that she didn't have any concerns that she had all the information that she needed um and the support and the resources the outcome was that she was able to make a successful presentation um to the leadership of the internship program and as well to a number of her cohorts um she did go back to princeton at the end of the summer and most recently she did request that i provide her with a reference letter um which sort of summarized what she was able to accomplish here at ets during her two thousand fourteen um ivec internship so it was a successful internship she was satisfied with the outcome and what she learned um there were a number of seminars and learning opportunities for her and she did uh rise to the occasion in learning as well as um exhibiting and sort of communicating what she learned to the team
so most recently i was a member of a team where two individuals did not work well together um and that sort of surfaced and some conversation and i believe they weren't working well together because they were just competing priorities um so their focuses were different um and also their objectives and their roles were also different um and they have different responsibilities so the behaviors that i carried out in response to the situation was that one person eventually um got up and they were probably about five or six people in this particular meeting as well one person you know pretty much put on the table what their expectations were that their expectations were not met and left the meeting the other person uh turned to me um um believing that i had some responsibility and maybe even the lack of communication or understanding of ensuring that those the expectations were met um i my behavior was pretty much just a focus on what the outcome of the task needed to be and to ensure that both expectations were met um so at that time what i did was just try and refocus um some of the discussion you know sort of um repeat what i heard um and ask for the information that i needed in order to take the next steps um in terms of some of the behaviors that were exhibited in that exchange i did have some slight conversation about how we should handle ourselves professionally um but other than that just really reworking the task to make sure that both parties um were satisfied with the outcome
you know this particular question sort of um with the focus on gaining the trust of others that you're working with um on one hand i'm thinking about sort of a personal situation and on the other hand i'm thinking about uh you know sort of a working relationship uh and i'm going to say for the for a working relationship um i was tasked with working with a temp on some mapping um exercises um i don't think that she was very knowledgeable and i don't think that she was trained in all of some of the competencies that she needed to come to the table with so i was trying to convince her that uh here's how things have been done in the past and that there needed to be some level of change management as we move towards how she was trying to pull at the task i mean sort of manage it from an administrative so she was more in an administrative role the behavior that i carried out in response to that was trying to make sure that she understood the parties that were already engaged um in that particular task before what we had come to expect and sort of highlighting some of the different things that she was trying to roll out and just talking about you know how we can just sort of smooth over and make sure she could get to what she wanted but that we could also um ensure that it wasn't too disruptive to how we were managing the task previously such as having some of those conversations i think nit was more collaborative in ensuring that we both understood sort of our role and the outcome was that the task did get done and going forward the um tasks are successful because it's an ongoing sort of working relationship
so a few weeks ago uh there was we were working on some iso registration activity and uh we had to work to ensure across the quality engineering team that a certain number of tasks were completed before the registrar came in so that's the background of the situation uh mutually favorable outcome was that we were having daily meetings first thing in the morning with all the quality engineers uh talking about you know sort of going through the status of every action item so they were quite a few and we were mainly focusing on those that were delinquent or past due between a sixty day time frame the morning meetings were not in my opinion going very well uh so one of the behaviors that uh i carried out in response to that situation was a discussion that said that very directly very straight forward that you know didn't i felt like the meetings could be run a little differently uh and the way that the discussions were being had we weren't providing strategy and sort of help and assistance with getting the action items complete but it was sort of berating uh so the outcome was i ended up having to run the meeting so mutually favorable outcome meant that we were able to as a team work together to complete the task but it was more focused on not why this the and why it isn't done but here's what we need to do in order to get this particular task completed so the outcome was that we were able to work down uh the delinquencies of the action items
so probably about i want to say at least probably a month and a half ago i'm sitting around with the board of quality excellence team um and we send out notifications to the ets organization um about process competencies that need to be completed process competencies are um reviews and sort of training on work instructions that you're responsible for in your roleuh what ended up happening was we were sending out you know um notifications for competencies that needed to be complete but the note the communication itself was not effective so you would receive an email and there would be links in that email that were designed to help you complete the task but the communication itself had a link that sort of took you to not to sort of the long route to completing the task um and you know after talking with some of my internal stakeholders um it had gotten highlighted that the communication was not effective and so i went to the broader the broader team and said we should probably change this link so that it takes them directly to um what the documents they need to see and review and complete competency on so not only did i suggest what i thought would be more effective communication i also there were some doubts in the room that that link could be provided in that email but i also um you know came up with the link tested it out and sent it to the system admins for them to go ahead and review it for effectiveness and the outcome of that whole situation was that the communications were changed um and it included a direct link for those that needed to receive the communication
there are not many people that i don't like or not get along with what i will say is that sometimes there is a personality conflict and i don't take it personally uh but there is a particular i don't know if it's a particular time because it's ongoing i work with the person uh pretty consistently but the person i'm a person that i believe i'm very confident and i like uh a decent amount of autonomy when i do my work uh there's a particular person uh that micro manages and so uh you know and there's sort of that there's sort of a conflict there uh and so what i do is i try and i did talk with my mentor i did seek some outside help once the how to manage the situation so that i wasn't sort of rubbed and that person didn't feel like i wasn't you know so that we could built trust so that she wouldn't micro manage uh and i now interact with the person by overwhelming her with information so to keep her from micro managing so i figure if i'm more proactive at providing information on tasks and things like that then uh i won't be micromanaged or told specifically how to do something uh the outcome is that it's a work in progress uh you know it has i think the relationship has gone but i don't even know if she sees the sort of relationship as a problem because i haven't said i don't like this uh i just have thought about trying to manage it so that for me it's a little bit more comfortable so i continue to manage it
in terms of uh unpleasant tasks shared uh amongst employees i can necessarily say that in anything that i do there's anything that's physically demanding but sometimes tedious and boring uh yeah there's a lot of sort of administrative such things that have to get done um and i'll definitely say that i prefer the sort of human interaction um and sort of problem solving um uh portion of my particular role uh so there are times when i'm assigned i feel you know certain issues that are outside of what i've been assigned responsibility to and i generally just tend to i generally just tend to manage it um and so for example if there's a kappa determination that uh is outside of maybe one of my assigned functional areas i'll try and look for how it does relate to an area or function that i am assigned to and i'll try and sort of specifically negotiate with those people there are also um times when things that are assigned to other people that i feel should have been assigned to me and i'll also try and sort of shift and sort of negotiate where i'll take this particular assignment you'll take that particular assignment um so that at least in terms of getting the work done um i'm at least working with individuals that i have relationships with so the outcome is at the end of the day we know that our leadership wants all the assignments managed and so just sort of negotiating with my team members on who does what um i'll definitely sort of reach out to individuals that i have more of a relationship with um and i feel like that creates an efficiency in getting the work done even though it is boring sometimes
so there's an ongoing sort of program uh where considered design design for control activities uh and there i guess it's more around the issue is more around change management but for design for control a lot of times we're looking at programs that area already sort of operational and trying to ensure that we can ensure accuracy and timeliness of completion of sworn right? to the customer uh and now there's sort of been a shift to design doing design for control activities around uh programs that are not yet operational so actually putting controls and putting those things in place uh so um one of the leaders of the group sort of sets the stage for how you know for the task for me as a quality engineer in terms of following up on action items and controls and so on and so forth so i try to help the person understand that there's been a shift in responsibilities that more of the responsibility was shifted on my particular function that certain inputs that generally would be provided were not provided uh and that there were details uh that were left out and that it would cause more so i handled the situation by it's he doesn't share the same opinion that i do because he doesn't share um the burden of the additional work but i did what i did was i communicated what my concerns were um and i suggested that we have a meeting um that meeting has not been scheduled um and what i did do was was then i escalated it to uh my manager who has oversight of the activity just to let them know that there are some concerns and that we do need to have a meeting to ensure that at the end of the day that the design for control of activities get completed
you know in terms of listening skills uh i'd definitely say most times i am engaged on the forefront of any communications um i will say that um there was a particular instance that comes to mind where i communicated to someone something that uh was not you know that you know i was going on vacation and so on and so forth and that i couldn't complete a certain task within a certain time frame um and you know um essentially i had to sit down um with my manager and sort of understand what that communication needed to be and the future so um in terms of listening skills apparently i guess i must have missed some kind of initial communication um you know and what i need to do in the future is if i have any constraints on time lines given you know being on vacation or out of office i need to not communicate that to the person that's making the request but i need to communicate it to my manager first so that they can potentially um find some kind of workaround or someone else to delegate the task to so there was a communications problem i guess i was the problem in that particular instance but now i know how to better handle um any constraints with my schedule in order to make sure that tasks are completed
um a particular um instance it comes up when i had to communicate difficult information to my supervisor who's surrounding a kappa determination that must be sort of processed within a certain time frame um it's generally like it has to closed within five days and so the the issue owner that i had to follow up with was not being responsive so um what i needed to do was to communicate to my supervisor that all the steps that i had taken to try and reach out to the individual and get the information that was required to close it um i wasn't able um to get that done so i communicated via email um what the details of the kappa determination were who the issue owner was and that um i communicated to them via email via phone um and forwarded along a train of conversation that was evidence that i had made an effort to get this particular task completed um the outcome was that it did get escalated and it was something that uh my supervisor ended up having to follow up on and work uh to date i'm not sure that she's been able to get it closed but the outcome was that i don't like to ideally escalate things um i like to try and work it but once it get to the point that um you know metrics and things are not and it's in sort of it's sort of indicative of my performance or lack of performance then i have to sort of escalate it so it demonstrates that i've done i've taken a certain number of steps and actions to try and get it done
uh i did have a conversation with i have a son about what it is that i do at work um and i remember this was probably i don't know he was probably on the second or the third grade um and so i explained to him what it meant to be a quality engineer and to work in six sigma um and trying to explain what that means that i do and so one of the examples that i gave him was process mapping um and he was not familiar with process mapping he may have been familiar with like maps right? how to locate something but in terms of process mapping so in trying to explain to him sort of the details around process mapping we talked about how you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich um how you have to one you have to get a plate you have to get utensils you have your inputs are you know bread peanut butter jelly  the stuff that you have to take and so um so i sort of translated process mapping to an example of a situation that he actually had personal experience with um and the behavior that i carried out was trying to be perceptive of what his understanding was and translating it to his level of knowledge and understanding and the outcome was he understands what it is that in part what it is that i do at work and he's also a he also likes patterns so also there are times and just sort of explaining situations to him where i sort of map it out in sort or writing things down so he can just visually see it um that i also believe also helps him to understand technical things
as a waitress in a restaurant i had the position of being a leader but not with a leadership role since there is a manager and a boss that is in charge of the restaurant and their employees you have to stand in as a manager when the manager is no longer there my manager is a father and runs a golf course and a restaurant at the same time so he is very spread out his work load is very heavy and he does not spend a lot of time in the restaurant so therefore i had to assume a leadership role without formally being recognized from training employees to helping out in the kitchen to making quick decisions about what to do with messed up orders or uh doing things that normally a manager would do receiving people communicating with other staff was very important to my work situation and that's how i felt like i was a leader in work and not in work so as a leader without recognition i felt that i had got more out of my job because even though i wasn't being recognized i still had a very important job at the restaurant
and my past job as a waitress has made me be able to get a job in the student center at the college of new jersey where i moved from information desk worker to building assistant to now i am student manager and with that important role of being manager i have to be the motivation for my fellow employees as well as my coworkers i have to make sure that every task is completed on shift and that the goals and emotions felt while on shift are happy and positive with that there's sometimes problems with events and setups in the student center and as my role as a leader i have to make sure that all my employees are comfortable with doing last minute setups such as when an event is needing electrical equipment but it was not provided therefore everyone needs to work together and get the job accomplished so through a positive attitude and a smile on my face i believe that i motivated my employees as well to get the job done as well as enjoy their job with the task at hand
working on group projects is a part of college and knowing that not every person in the group will get along and work well together in order to get a group project uh accomplished we all have to do our part creating google docs using technology really helps situations in which members of the group did not agree for example when i was in my film class we had to make a movie about anything we chose from the beginning it was hard to agree on the topic and the script and the characters and where it was going to be located but compromising really helped the situation not only knowing our specific jobs such as one person was a camera the camera director and the next person was a script writer and the other people were the actors it really helped out uh when the group members did not work well together because each person had their specific job to work on and not only did that give someone the focus and drive to get the project accomplished but it also helped out the group as a whole so even if the two members did not agree on a specific thing that had to do with the project each one had their own specific jobs and that really helps the problem of not getting along and we got our group project done and that and we received an a on it so i believe that using technology and working together really helped to get the task accomplished
every time i go to work i have to negotiate with my employees whether to get the job done from coming in late to not doing their jobs to being very rude to customers i have to make sure that only are they doing their job correctly but they have trust in the people that they worked with and as well as with me negotiating with them from doing tasks to getting jobs accomplished to not getting in trouble by our professional staff really sums up the day that i have to do every day not only do i have to deal with staff members coming in late but they're also very rude to me and to the other fellow employees gaining the trust of others really has to do with communicating to them as if you are equals so making sure that everyone at work is equal and feel included and is a part of the team effort that really helps not only if i gain their trust then i can easily negotiate with them from not getting in trouble for coming in late and doing another job instead to get out of a proper punishment seems like a pretty good negotiation considering that they would get in trouble and are on the verge of being terminated fired from their position really helps my goal of getting a job accomplished so trust and negotiation are hand in hand with each other
in order to bargain and compromise with someone for a mutual favorable outcome i have to make sure that we are on a more personal level because if they trust me and then the compromise will be a lot easier for example on monday night my employee texted me at six o'clock stating that she was going to be late to work but she would bring me food to make sure that she did not get in trouble and i felt like that was a pretty good compromise for her to get a good outcome out of it because she would not get in trouble for what she had done because it isn't a very big deal if someone is late for a shift even an hour late which she was late an hour late but no one said anything because we've all got something out of it the compromise for all of us was pretty good and the outcome was even better
as a member of a sorority i have to make sure that i am pretty good at compromising and trying to persuade others of ideas that i have about myself or about positions i hold in the organization i am the publicity and historian chair for my sorority and i have to make sure that what i do is approved by the executive board i run the instagram the twitter and the facebook not only do i have to keep up with all these forms of social media but i have to make sure everything i post is accurate and important to our sorority not only posting about birthdays and sisters of the week but we have to post uh about on our events on campus and what other sororities are what they are doing such as other chapters from other schools and how they interact with us and what they need and how they'll reach out to us on all these forms of medias is very important but as the social media chair i had to bring to the attention of the executive board that i wanted to start a weekly picture post on instagram and i had to make sure this was going to be appropriate not only did i convince them that this was going to be a good idea but it was a success considering the amount of likes and publicity i did get from the post i started a 'travel tuesday' idea on our account and it was very well received not only did the sisters feel important but we also started to get our name out there more using instagram which is very important to recruiting new members and keeping membership high
working in a group setting is very important to college and the teacher especially in the work field not only do you have to work with people you don't like but you have to make sure that you do get the task accomplished even with a personal thing in the way every time you work someone even if you're great on a personal level it is important to get what you need to get done accomplished especially during college where i do have to work on a lot of group projects with another person from creating a project in the powerpoint to show to the class i had to make sure that we do not seem that we do not like each other it is very hard to get along with every single person you meet but if you do it in a professional and a way that no one is feelings so are then the situation will be okay especially in one of my classes where we have to give a powerpoint presentation and teach the class a lesson we have to make sure that we both know what we are doing and we have to make sure that we meet at a mutual time and place where we both will be able to work on this project and get receive a good grade for our efforts so it really doesn't matter if you do not like a person in a group but if you get what you need to get done then it shouldn't matter at all
completing unpleasant tasks are usually very prominent in minimum wage employees from usually if you're an intern or you just started off in a company you have to do a task that you really do not want to do from physically demanding tasks to boring tasks you have to make sure that you make every single job somewhat comical or funny because even if don't feel like doing it you have to make your time worthwhile in each task even though it's not something you would want to do you have to make sure you do it correctly to move on in another part of the company especially working in a restaurant knowing that people are rude and disgusting and cleaning up plates can be really gross and physically demanding at times and not enjoyable getting the job done and putting on a smile face is the most important thing from folding boxes for box lunches uh to cleaning plates in the kitchen waitressing sometimes doesn't seem like the best job or you might not be suited for it but if you seem to put a smile on your face and act as if it's a positive experience then it won't be tedious or boring especially while working at the golf course last summer i had to fold hundreds of hundreds of boxes for box lunches and that was very tedious but using my time wisely and talking and listening to music if you are allowed to made the job less boring so if you put a positive twist on everything it won't be unpleasant
in a group project it's very important for everyone's opinion to be heard ranging from the smallest thing as that the project should not be on a powerpoint to saying a couple of words that don't make sense to the project each opinion does have importance especially in a communications class where everyone has to participate it is very important to important to have your own opinion not only do you not want the other group members to take over the role of every single position but you also do not want your professors and fellow classmates not to recognize you as a substantial part of a group using the theory of group think where every person in the group has to think the same and is pressured to think the same even if they don't feel as if it's right that is a problem with a group project  groupthink is horrible and not easily ignored but it happens very easily as well every person in the group is almost peer pressured into thinking a certain way in doing something a certain way even though they are ignoring their own opinion so in order to stop groupthink every single person needs to have their own opinion in a group and especially in a communications class such as the ones i have to take i have to make sure that each person has their own say and is heard especially in the film class i took using having roles and putting in their opinion was very important even though it seemed long the meetings were long and tedious it really helped everyone feel as if they are an individual and a member of the group
one of the main problems with working with other people is communication communication is always a problem ranging from your young years on sport teams to the working world knowing that communication is always going to be a problem and that certain people won't be heard listening is an important skill to acquire from listening to employers complain about their problems and not responding also gives them a chance to vet and get out their issues especially at my job over the summer where i was an intern in a research company we had to order binders on binders in order to put studies to go out to the coordinators of studies in other states the binders had to be the correct size and the people ordering them sometimes ordered the wrong size because they were not listening and that was a communication's problem  and just standing there even though i had a less important role in the company standing there and listening to the people complaining about what other people said to them and how they went wrong really helped them then and helped them not bring a negative attitude to the rest of the company even from the smallest thing of just standing there and listening to the problems a person discuss their problem really helps the work environment and not only helps the other people become more productive listening can also help a person recognize that they were wrong in a situation and they should have done something in a certain way or they should apologize for doing something apologizing to the woman that she had freaked out on about ordering the wrong binders was the correct thing to do after she discussed it with someone and as a bystander someone that does not have a say is always good
while i was working for my internship over the summer i had to make sure that every single paper i was copying was in the correct order and some of the information was not there in using critical skills and knowing that each part of this study i was copying making sure that each paper clip and each staple was in the correct spot was very important to the job at hand because these studies were going out to the companies that needed them and we were in charge of very valuable information and knowing that sometimes the information was not there telling my boss that the information was not properly done before hand was very difficult because she was very involved in the study and knowing that someone didn't do their job correctly and that could affect her job was very valid and very important to the way she felt about her job so handling in a positive manner and making sure to tell her in a private setting was very important with no one around because then other people would stick their heads in and not contribute positively to the issue instead of just getting task accomplished and fixed and making sure that each part of the information was put in the folder correctly
each day i work as the student center i have to handle all the electrical equipment in the student center from setting up projectors to turning on lights to making sure a movie or a film or computer is hooked up to a projector is very important to my job in order to get my job done at times and be in charge of the building itself i have to make sure that i can explain to my fellow co-workers that know nothing about the media and the electrical equipment have to put it together from putting up projectors to hooking something into the wall it is very difficult to explain technical things that go on in the student center but using common language and making sure walking a person step by step through the process really helps get the job done for example the other day i had to setup a room with a couple of projectors a screen and each part i needed some help from my building assistant and i made sure that they knew exactly what they were doing  and if they had any questions that they would ask that really helped get the job done
okay well a work situation in which i wasn't the formal leader but tried to take on leadership role um well my current job basically is being a student so this would apply to basically every group project ever i love being in charge of things and i love just kind of having the reigns on situations so basically in every group project i've ever done i've tried to be the leader so one instance is was very recently we had a group just discussion in class but i always insist on just kind of giving people things to do i consider what they're good at what i perceive them to be good at whether that is or is not true i consider what they say what they want to do and then i'll try since i'm not a formal leader i'll try to nudge them into doing what i want them to do sometimes if that doesn't work i'll explicitly say you should do this and usually even though i don't have a formal leadership position they will do it and it usually works out well because i typically have a good direction i can't think of an incidence where it didn't work out well other than the times that somebody else tried to do what i was doing and take an informal leadership role during these situations we tend to butt heads a bit more but it's still very productive and we still i'm very good at if somebody else if somebody else tries to take leadership i'm very good at just kind of relinquishing the power and i can kind of be like the beta to their alpha whatever it is in wolf packs i don't know but i'm very good at kind of going with what they want to do but enforcing kind of their ideals and not their ideas for the situation so in all in all it never really works out badly when i try to assume the leadership role or once anyway
in my current role as a student i don't really have subordinates so it does not really apply to me and if i do have subordinates it's just in my mind nobody else is real well but i think of them like that but what i do have would be coworkers which would be my peers my friends and all the time we like to have study groups together really just genuinely not just enjoy being in each other's company but we feel that we can work better when we do with each other because we each have different strengths and different weaknesses and we can pick each other up where we tend to fall so back on a situation i'll give you one from like last week we were all studying for a spanish exam and some of my friends are really bad at spanish i'm very good at spanish so we're working together we're doing this then all of a sudden we kind of just lost our steam we stopped doing it as well and then we got distracted there's girl's on like facebook there's others who are just not literally not paying attention texting their boyfriends  so me and my other friend we both like to take kind of a leadership role we were like okay if we study for one more hour we can go get froyo and every girl ever loves froyo even if they say don't they secretly do so they are like all very into they're like okay let's do this and for that one hour they were very gung-ho about it and i feel like the promise of the reward at the end was an incredible motivator for them because it was something that they wanted something that they look forward to so in any situation i feel like kind of offering incentives for people to do their best or to do well or to try really is the best way to go about it because i don't think it's possible for there to be a bad outcome if you're offering people something they want in exchange for something that they are fully within their power to do which is exactly what happened in that situation with my group of peers
so around two years ago i was working on a nursing project with um a group of girls that i had been assigned so none of us in any other situation would really have chosen each other but there is this one girl she was very party girl very like me me me like to have a good time let everyone know it and another girl who was very quiet she was an rotc she just very like wholesome kind of morally extremely sound and then this girl who just fundamentally who did not get along and of course they had to put them together in my group so that wasn't bad for like the first two days then they started really just getting under each other's skin they would purposefully just sabotage the others work and then blamed it on them and just kind of be like oh well she can't do anything right we shouldn't give her things to do in this project so there is nothing really that we could do since they didn't get along on such a deep down level so what me and the other girl who had been in the group tried to do was we just kind of sat down and set up meeting as a group for the project  we were just like listen you guys are being kind of ridiculous you need to get over this you don't have to be friends after this you don't have to talk to each other again we just need to finish our project present it and then be done with it you guys do not have to associate with each other after this after that uh they realized that what we were saying was right and even though they didn't really want to hear it it was what they needed to get from the other members of the group they needed to know that they were just kind of being ridiculous so after we had that whole discussion they for in the next week they kind of still were jamming at each other but after that they just got over it they didn't talk to each other they refused to speak to each other which was fine because we didn't need them to speak to each other to do well but they did end up both putting in their equal part and presenting and everything went very smoothly more so than we ever could have imagined
when working with anyone i feel like you need to have trust there whether it's just kind of ingrained in them to trust you and you to trust them or whether you have to earn it so in situations where trust is key like in every situation um i usually try to get them to trust in my ability and myself as a person before everything else so in order to gain their trust as a person basically all i do is i make them like me as a person because i feel like once you like someone as a person it's easier to trust them but in order to make them trust in my abilities that's often a bit more difficult um i'll somehow just segue into a story about this time that i did this thing that was completely related to our assignment even if it's not and give them details about it that make me seem just very competent and make it seem like i know what i'm doing um that's all you really can do in that situation you just have to repeatedly give them reasons to trust you in order for them to do so i've never been unsuccessful in getting people to trust me in a work situation i feel like if somebody doesn't trust you in a work situation that's your fault like it's really not difficult to gain trust in that situation because it's so easy to get and there's no reason for them to not trust you because it's such a superficial situation that i don't really know it's just trust actually hasn't been something that i would really consider much on a deep level i feel like i just naturally trust people when i work with them because i have to you're kind of forced to if you don't trust them then you don't get anything done
okay so i bargain and compromise a lot in work situations it's the way i know best to get things done because then people would be more likely to do what you ask them if you give them something in return so my best friend and i we often do this kind of bartering exchange where she's very good at things that i'm very bad at so in order for me to get her help on things i'll have to give her help on things so typically what we do is if we're like say outlining a few chapters of a book i'll get her to outline them not them but the ones that she has most familiarity with and the ones that she feels most comfortable with and then i'll do the ones that i feel the most comfortable with because usually they are just at the polar ends of the spectrum and then we'll just exchange so she'll give me the ones that she did i'll give her the ones i did i also do this in my family with my sisters i feel like in families if you don't barter are you really even a family because sometimes you just want something of them but god knows siblings will not do anything unless you're helping them so they'll be like oh i won't tell mom that you did this if i can borrow that sweater next weekend and that usually works what else do i compromise? just generally in work situations when you don't quite agree on something as often a compromise has to be reached in order for you to be productive yeah i feel like this is just a very general question because generally you always have to compromise if you and someone else both feel very strongly about something bargaining is a bit different but i already addressed that so no
so i've always had a very i think they label it 'expressive' an expressive uh communication style so i do when i need to persuade people instead of relying on facts and logic and just very straightforward i often take the approach where i use my opinions and emotion and i feel like that's a very effective way to get people to see things your way because it's a lot easier to sway people based on like oh this is so awful how could you believe that? or like it makes me so sad that you would think that instead of just saying facts that are just very straightforward cut and dried black and white the gray area i feel is what convinces people most often than the other ends of the spectrum so what's the time? i can't think of a specific time but i know myself and i know what i do it's just i really use the facts on situation i'll lay them out but i don't use them as a persuasive tool as often as i'll use my own opinions or my own feelings about a subject  i'll just instead of setting up the facts and saying this is this what do you think? i'll just keep coming at them and be like why do you feel this way? what could i do to change your opinion? this is my opinion why is your opinion different? can i hear your opinion? what do you think differently about this subject that i should know and i feel like eventually you can convince them to see it from your perspective and they are much more likely to change their own opinions to yours if you keep just giving them reasons to that are based within emotion and um uh i don't know
i tried so hard to think of a situation where i had to work with someone i don't like and get along with but i honestly couldn't because i'm one of those people where i try to see the good in people even if they're horribly annoying or awful person i like to try to find something about them that i can relate to that'll make it easier for me to work with them and get along with them i can't think of a single person i don't like purely based on this um if i don't initially like someone i will work with them as i work with any other person i try not to let that get in the way of things and then eventually somewhere along the line i'll warm up to them and i will like them but to be completely honest i cannot think of a single situation where any amount of dislike i might have held for a person got in the way of me being productive and me doing the task at hand or something that i needed to do
in this situation it would honestly depend on which kind of unpleasant taskum i know the physically demanding tasks i'd be like no thanks like you guys can do that if you give me more than my fair share of that i'd be very upset but um  the tedious and boring tasks those just typically have to do with just things that you do repeatedly and just kind of on and on and on but in general that's the kind of stuff i like i like how methodical it is i like just the routine of it so i usually get more than my fair share of that task the tasks that i don't enjoy are the ones where you have to really this sounds bad where you really have to just actively think about it or you have to be very creative where you have to think on the spot and that is not the kind of thing i enjoy but typically that's the kind of thing that other people enjoy so they'll usually scoop up that responsibility and i'll take the tedious boring task that nobody else wants because i find it very relaxing this happens a lot in um my internship because i am an intern so as they are doing things calling people i work in a health insurance firm as they're doing things calling people i'm usually just scanning things copying things entering things into spreadsheets sending out mass emails that is what i like to do i find it just really the methodicalness of it just comforting and that's what i enjoy doing and they just welcome me doing it because it is something that they find tedious boring unpleasant and that they want to get off their plate as soon as possible so i don't typically have problems in this area with other people or with other group members or co-workers
i can't really remember the context of this situation but i do know that i've been in a group working on a group project before where someone's all consuming leadership has been an issue and the other people in the group were bothered by it because the person was not taking any input they were just saying okay we're going to do this this this you're going to do this and then people would try to offer up opinions because the girl was not doing a spectacular job she was just doing what she wanted to do and she wasn't listening because i had some pretty great ideas to be completely honest but uh she just wasn't listening she wasn't incorporating them she was just like uh-huh and threw them by the way side so the other people in the group didn't want to confront her because they didn't want to cause tension or issues and in the middle of group discussion one day i just got so fed up with it i was just like are you kidding? and she was like what do you mean? and i just said to her i was like you are being completely unfair you are being a tyrant you need to stop just generally things of that nature  eventually she was kind of offended by it i'll be honest but it was for the good of the group because after i kind of chastised her and yelled at her a little she stepped down and it became more of a group effort after that there was no more all consuming leadership role it was just us pitching our opinions we changed around a lot of what had already been done but we left in some of what she had wanted to be fair because we couldn't cut her out completely like she did to us so all in all i think it went pretty well sometimes you just have to be very firm in what you want and how you think you need to act in order just to get it and sometimes it's better to cause a little tension in the group if it's for the overall and greater good of the group as a whole
i feel like or no i feel as though using listening skills in order to overcome communication problems isn't just a work problem at all i feel that's just a life problem because you're always going to encounter people who don't want to listen to what you have to say or who hear what you have to say and just take it the wrong way or ignore it completely um i feel like especially within my group of peers who i often have to work with there's a lot of incidences where someone just misconstrues something that's said by another person or there's a lot of he-said she-said and that often causes issues what i tend to do is i'll go straight to the source regardless of which one of my friends is having an issue i'll go straight to the source and be like hey what did you say or hey did you actually say this? and usually they are very quick to clarify what happened and then i can just kind of report back like this isn't really an issue you just didn't understand what she was saying or this isn't an issue because she never actually said that so i feel like it's not so much how you listen it's so much how you listen it's not what you hear it's how the person says it and i feel like it's very important to pay attention to how the person says it because if you don't then it can cause a lot more harm than good it can cause a multitude of issues that wouldn't have been there if you would have just taken the time out to truly listen to what they have to say
i've never been in a situation where i've needed to relay difficult information to supervise or a very critical feedback because even in my internship i'm not highly ranked enough to be interested with information or feedback that would just be very inappropriate for me to have to go to my head boss and be like hey you messed this up because that's not something that an intern should tell someone even in my peer group i don't think i would be the one who would have to give difficult information if i were in that situation i would probably i forget what read about this i think it's called the sandwich method or something but you preface the difficult information or critical feedback with like a positive thing like oh you did a very nice job on the presentation the other day and then critical feedback so you'd be like but there is this issue with this and you should have done this better and you shouldn't have done this and then just one more positive thing you'd say but overall it was very well done i just think there is some minor tweaks that you make  i feel like that would be the best way to relay difficult information or critical feedback because it let's the person know hey you did do not even hey you did a good job it's just i value the effort you put into it i value your contributions but there was significant problems with it or there was even minor problems with it it just lets them know that they are valued but at the same time they could do better and you expect them to do better in the future and you expect them to rectify whatever mistakes they might have made
okay so every summer i kind of go through a stage where i am extremely all consumingly interested in something just because i have so much free time so a few summers back it was greek methodology that was skate boarding then there was modern art just a bunch of random things but this past summer it was string theory and i was so so incredibly into string theory i still find it super interesting but nowhere near the level where i was just consumed by it this summer so one of my sister's knowing that i was just for a little time being i had been so interested in it and she found it interesting too she was like hey what exactly is this? it sounds really interesting but i don't get it and of course string theory is one of the most technical things ever it's really complicated really confusing i still don't know if i completely get it but i told myself i did so the best way i found to explain this super duper complex technical thing to her is just say it in layman's terms so instead of giving her like the super complex technical definition i'd be like oh well string theory says that at the most basic level instead of molecules atoms everything is made up of tiny vibrating strings and that gives someone a visual much more so than an actual full complex description of it and then i let her borrow this book that i was reading that did the exact same thing it's like the idiots guide to string theory and the both of us being idiots about string theory thought it was just super incredibly helpful so i feel like giving people information about something that explains it in a way we'll understand is the best way to do that whether it be literature or verbal explanation or a diagram or anything giving them just concrete resources that they could reference during an explanation or for an explanation are just immensely helpful in any situation
sure i'd be happy to provide you uh the information um in my last position uh as a database administrator um one of the most challenging um uh situations was to um involve other database administrators while working on any specific problem that impacted multiple databases and um one of the situations that um are good was um the performance related photo for ibt and it um had crashed during one uh during an admin uh on a sunday um on a saturday uh and um our manager asked um the dba for the um application to look into it however the answers were not really clear and i stepped in as um one of the other dbas and without making it uh very obvious i had to take the leadership role and um assessing the performance impact and also working in a collaborative manner with many other vendors like csc and oracle to come to um and uh create the rfc for it which is or the root cause analysis was done uh primarily um in uh i work with the other dbas um but i did it primarily on my own and i led the other dbas to um uh help me however the work had to be completed on a certain time so i basically led the situation um and the outcome was um that we resolved the issue uh in a timely manner and we saved the company um um a good deal of uh about a quarter million dollars from not having the disaster repeated
um one of the ways as a lead database administrator i it was uh my responsibility to motivate other junior database administrators who were brought in uh and we had to i had to mentor uh them as the key men um in a particular situation um about um uh six months back there was a situation where we um had to roll out the annual audit system where um about seven thousand database accounts had to be audited and um since it was not something that one individual could like for example i was the lead for it i was not really going to be able to audit all seven thousand plus uh database accounts so i had to um send out reminders to every dba however i noticed that um email reminders were not working and so i had to opt uh for a different ah option and uh what i did was um i called a meeting and uh motivated them by um um uh taking the responsibility um for their own applications uh for their own databases uh in a way that they were um going to be rewarded for having um completed um their tasks in a timely manner and um we had um i also organized um um daily meetings for the next one week um and after their um checking and checked in with uh each dba and um once that i i felt that once they were um once the dbas uh felt that uh there was uh they were going to be recognized
uh this was a kind of a sticky situation where uh in uh one of the uh application performance uh issues where there were two database administrators who were responsible for uh the application and our manager uh wasn't available during that time and it so happened that it was escalated up the chain to uh had to escalate to executive managers and because of the disaster that it created uh uh i had to step in uh to resolve the issue uh but i felt that the group uh dynamics were not working and particularly because they're two lead dbas who are responsible for it were not seeing eye to eye on and had issues in uh they are working in two different basically two in parallel uh trying to resolve the same issue but uh not meeting eye to eye so uh i tried to again arrange for a meeting to see what the issues were between them and uh try to look at it from each person's point of view and uh eventually uh i was able to uh get them to resolve the issue by working together once they realized that they were both working on the same problem and had to uh come up with uh a solution which was going to resolve the problem for the business uh and not necessarily prove to the manager that one of them had to they had to work as a team basically and that's what i was conveying to them
um so as part of the cloud-enabled um application deployment strategy team um it was um sometimes necessary to work with many different teams from different parts of it and uh this was outside uh the scope of my responsibility at the time when i joined it last year um although it was outside um there i was given the responsibility by my manager as something that i could do above and beyond um but many a times i noticed thatum ah and i had to gain the trust of others by um proving to them that this is an area that i could work on um by um i could work on even though i did not have the expertise uh in that and the way that i did was doing all the research work on the cloud and taking some extra courses that i could um  in order to come in order to get up to speed on um cloud strategy um um the i felt the outcome was pretty successful because during the presentation that i've created um people are very happy and ah the proposal was actually accepted from uh for the database uh perspective database cloud strategy and um um
so recently and now trying to evaluate the technology for uh nosql which is uh pretty new in the area of cloud um strategy um i had to work with someone um in a different team and um while there are some about one hundred eighty or more um nosql technologies and it's a vast area and picking a particular technology and evaluating and researching um was um um a kind of a gray area because it was not yet decided nosql is such a it's so new even in um the technology area that um companies still have to make um decisions to pick at least more than one technology but it was not something that um um could that was easily um uh that could be easily decided so i mean while working with the other person from the other team i had to um come up with um with a multiple solutions in order to um meet uh the expectations that he um had um as a um more experienced um um employee um in the end um i felt that um the technology that i picked um was not uh really um going to be uh accepted um but um i looked uh i then reviewed the technology that the other person picked and i uh researched that in more depth and did the comparison and i felt eventually that it was the right uh decision that was made by the other employee
uh one of the most challenging um issues that uh i faced in the last year was when uh the two toefl ibt had uh uh an outage and uh after the outage it was as the lead application db for toefl ibt i was uh given the responsibility to uh uh figure out what the issue was or what the root cause was uh during uh the root cause analysis uh it was very obvious to me that it was not the database that had the issue uh which was the root cause but it was very difficult to prove uh to a lot of people uh uh for example the vendors and uh put the infrastructure where the issue was but i could however prove that the database was not the issue but it was difficult to uh convince uh uh everyone so what i did was i uh actually mined the data from uh our repository uh which is used for monitoring the uh environment uh when i started mining i was not able to actually look at many of the information so i took uh i opened a service account with oracle but oracle said that that is not something could mined then i found a way to mine it and eventually i produced reports uh which is trend analysis of uh reports from uh the data that i mined and uh i overcame the challenges that uh oracle even said will not be able to that is not possible basically and uh i think the outcome was pretty good i was given the presidential award for it uh and uh that report still runs and it's uh sent out to upper management on a regular basis which has been automated at this point and we have avoided many disasters because of that
sure so it's not very uh often that i do not like someone with who i work with i've been working for two decades now but uh it's been the rare occasions that i have not got along with a few people it's primarily because they had issues with i noticed uh uh with a female in technology and that was not something uh that was obvious but a more of what with the few interactions uh and  very uh targeted emails it became obvious what the situation what the issues were and it happened twice and both times uh i tried to resolve the issue by uh you know talking to the person uh and when it did not get resolved when some when uh derogatory emails or condescending emails started coming in or even you know even in conversations it uh was brought up uh i had to uh uh engage my manager and uh basically let my manager know that uh this was not something that could be tolerated uh uh my manager was able to talk to the person and uh eventually it was settled and uh we worked together for a very long time after that and we had we do not have any more issues uh uh but it's pretty rare that i don't have that i have problems getting along with people at work
um unfortunately i can't think of a time when i was given any unpleasant tasks i have this habit of uh asking for more work or getting into work uh areas and taking on more work so i'm actually i don't have a situation where i had unpleasant task um that i had to take care of um i always like doing what i've been doing and maybe i got lucky
uh this is uh pretty common uh in uh the in it i feel where there are people who step in in group projects and assume leadership without giving a lot of uh credibility to the other team members and when it happened uh in my last project uh there was uh a self assigned group leader who did not like uh the ideas that were brought forward by other group members including mine and when noticed that and i felt that the opinions that were being brought forward by others were significant i had to i had a one on one with the group leader and uh uh tried to uh basically uh uh made a chart of all the ideas that were brought up and uh we reviewed uh together uh most of the all the  contributions and uh did a rating for the contributions and while we did it together and we basically when we worked together got him to buy in to most of the contributions uh that were brought in by others including mine and uh in the end i feel um uh we were able to uh give importance to the other contributions that were being brought in and uh we all had a successful project
uh so not so long ago i was at a meeting with uh some of the senior members of our team uh and uh our csc uh leaders were talking about big data and they were presenting uh some big data uh uh slides and opportunities that we have in going in that area uh uh while during the presentation uh there was one particular slide that had some uh verbiage which was not very uh clear and one of our uh one of my colleagues uh the senior architect he was not not able to actually present our data he uh had an he was not he was misinterpreting the slide and started asking questions which uh uh which made it clear that he was not getting what uh or he was sidetracking from the real uh idea behind the presentation uh so i actually offered like two minutes of the conversation i stepped in and uh i explained my view of how i interpreted the uh uh slide and uh i realized that the csc uh leadership was not able to understand where uh my colleague was coming from and i understood where he was coming from and i explained to him what the slide was explaining and uh he just like a light bulb he realized that's what it meant and he was very happy that i explained the situations and now it makes sense and uh we then proceeded to the next slide
so then in my role as the lead dba for critical applications there have been many occasions where a have to provide um uh critical feedback to my manager on how the application team was uh working with uh me or how or in which manner uh i could uh influence the application team in order for them to uh bring about some changes which would eventually help uh the performance of the uh application and the database uh uh most often i felt very comfortable approaching my manager uh i actually have never felt uncomfortable uh i have been able to communicate uh to my manager by setting up a meeting and by talking face to face uh about the situation and in this particular case it was a situation where the application team uh was not uh uh ready to bring about uh or implement a change that was uh really necessarily in order to meet the requirements of the performance and uh i set up a meeting with my manager talk to him and he was able to communicate to that and uh uh to the application manager and eventually we were able to implement the solution which uh was required for uh the database performance and at times it's been also uh required for me to provide feedback to my manager about some other dba who uh did not complete a certain uh task uh that needed to be completed and i believe it was all handled amicably in the end
um in the recent cloud-enabled deployment um uh as part of the team for the cloud-enabled deployment application deployment um there were many um non technical um senior executives uh who had to uh be brought up to speed with the technical uh aspect of the uh deployment and it was um in many situation i felt it was um since we're so technical people it becomes difficult to explain it so during the presentation that i was preparing i made sure that i did enough research behind the technical um for the technical jargon to um uh explain in non technical terms what it meant um there were i made sure there were no technical abbreviations used and if it were used uh it was expanded um and um the impact at um the presentation that was created was so well uh received by um the um executive director uh who that he came up to me and he said that um he is a complete he's not technical and he really understood and the only presentation that he understood was mine um um it was difficult but i in the end uh the terms and terminologies that were used in the presentation uh helped uh convey the uh technical message in a non technical manner but i did the research uh for it to make it happen
i would say the best job that fits this scenario would be my first internship at the faa when i worked for atandt advanced sciences and technology i was a junior in high school and there i was more of a um less experienced uh amateur in the workforce where there were definitely senior members in the group and in this internship we had to perform several tasks which meant uh giving either giving presentations on or laboratoriesum  developing brochures etcetera so with the senior management we had to take on several roles such as giving these presentations so we do not i did not lead uh myself and another coworker who was on the job with me we did not lead these presentations but we had to do our part so in that we did our best to prepare the brochure uh to make sure it was well prepared for other senior managers um in addition we also partook in several of the um presentations for the labs um in addition we had roles in working in the back laboratories um not really taking on the major roles but doing the little tasks uh just to you know do our part and the outcome was we had a strong group we were a group of high school and college students so it was well received and the majority of our presentations we had to deliver to other high school college students and also senior managers uh at the faa which is the federal aviation technology i mean federal aviation administration um it was well received and so from the years on um from my junior senior year at high school and also my freshman sophomore year in college uh they continued this uh opportunity for us to um give the presentations because that year was actually our first year of trying it out so it was definitely well received
i would say this would fall into my senior year at uh this scenario would fall into my senior year working at uh the federal aviation administration when i was more uh senior member of the group and where i had uh younger individuals of my group which were in my same position and the way i went about instilling this positive uh enforcement and empowerment was the same way in which my senior members my first year uh did to me and so simply that was by uh not delegating but rather uh inquiring and seeing what people feel comfortable to do and also working with them uh so for instance when we would go practice for our presentations it would be me and then allowing them to uh present the material they would like always giving them positive reinforcement areas in improvement that they would see uh that they could have and uh it was simply just positive reinforcement and uh just positive reinforcement and uh the outcome was uh again it was well received uh from the younger group members and uh you know from that uh from their  first couple uh presentations of our labs uh in addition they began to take on more roles on new material uh started to introduce our presentations rather than uh taking a later portion of the presentation so it allowed them to be a little more confident in public speaking in various groups uh which were senior managers college students and also high school students so uh the outcome was that they were much more confident in the material that they are represent also because uh i also told them the importance of being well prepared uh making the script of their material more uh suitable and tailored to their needs uh and how they like to speak so uh the outcome was very good
best scenario that would fit this would not be in the work setting but more with my fraternity um i'm on the e board and in that uh my uh president and vice president of my organization did not really get along to well um definitely a clash in you know motives goals um delegation and how to run the organization so the best way in which i thought that i handled the situation um was to create comfortable environment at our um e board meetings um a lot of times when we would meet there would be a lot of um conflict in interest conflict in um styles of leadership and a lot of times when people would talk they would be talking over one another and it led to a lot of arguments and definitely no progressive um solution so one of the best things that i did was simply um propose a way in order to go about uh our meetings simply raising awareness that everybody has their own strengths and uh their own strengths and skills um and the best way utilize one of the strengths and skills is to raise the awareness and listen without judgment kind of come to the table with a blank ah slate and um be willing to accept what everybody has and in that you know it definitely raised the awareness of everybody's strengths um and i would have to say that our organization definitely shot through the roof we actually had you know we were on a decline our members weren't really coming out they didn't have too many brothers coming in because we had a lot of seniors graduating in return we had 26 guys joined our organization all of which stopped with our entire our process which was um very um a very motivating and um positive note to start our year off on
this scenario definitely falls into uh more recent uh situations uh at my school the college of new jersey i'm in the process of developing a new interpersonal organizational club for my major in addition to a program so with that i don't necessarily know how to do that but i know that there are um several of my uh you know my classmates and other leaders of the community who know how to do these types of things so with that being said i had to uh meet with them and also uh allow them to give me uhtheir rubric their skills um the things that have worked for their organizations so i started meeting with my chair of the department also the uh chair of the interpersonal organizational club uh building that trust simply by using a philosophy i've learned from 'how to win friends and influence people' simply about inquiring about their interest and their needs and then responding with empathy um and simply asking what their uh best advice is how to go about it and then proposing mine uh in addition to considering what they said uh so we can come to an end goal because in order to succeed in this initiative for an interpersonal organizational club and a program to drive that club i definitely need others with uh higher authority who have other skills and knowledge so uh the opportunity definitely arose when i learned to um you know inquire about their interest or needs and then also cater uh my initiatives and ideas to their needs and uh it was very so florida is going very well uh lots of people are on board including senators of the communications department uh member of the student advisory board which are both the president and the vice president the chair of the department and also chair of the interpersonal organizational club so all of which are behind this initiative and club uh which is absolutely outstanding
the scenario that will fall into an incident uh last semester which would be my spring twenty fourteen semester at tcnj when i was working in a group project with one of my fraternity brothers and also two other members uh and initially it was myself and one other member and the professor asked myself and one member to bring along my fraternity brother because uh he didn't particularly think his idea or um his topic would suit the objective um of the class so with that being said i had to reach out to my fraternity brother and tell him the scenario um of you know in a um light and um sincere way um and uh with that i kind of introduce that uh the professor was very excited about our idea and uh he'd be willing to help us out uh moving forward because there's something new which was uh uh the canadian pipeline uh which started from canada and rode down all the way down to mexico uh and uh i mentioned that he would be willing to help us and that uh i told my fraternity brother which is tom pellogrino that uh if he came along with us it would definitely help us uh moving forward and um help us solidify a good grade in the end so with that he actually joined our group and uh we had a collective effort lots of help from our professor and at the end we are all satisfied with our grade in the class
this past summer i received an internship opportunity and a job opportunity uh that would take place in manhattan uh i was facilitating for a uh diversity inclusion initiative for the employees of cox media group and in that i was very excited and basically told my mother uh that i would be taking on this internship which we were taking in manhattan and her concern was i would not be able to handle my school work um let alone my obligations with my fraternity and take on every other obligations that i had so uh what i did was i realized the way that my mother prefers to think she's a very analytical person she is a uh senior manager for the faa and so she's very organized she'd like to see that i have a plan uh step by step process and so what i did was um introduce her with a proposal uh basically clearing all the concerns she had and number one concern was that uh me handling my school with additional fifteen hour requirement for my internship which would take place in manhattan um handling uh the spanish which was something new to us taking on this year it's required for my class and um uh yeah so those were two of the concerns and so what i simply did was i gave her a proposal uh clearing all those mentioning that last year i had a job giving about six and a half hours in additional to my school work and my obligation with the fraternity um and also the fact that i have three days off of school this semester um which would take place of my internship so i would have plenty of time to get my school work done and since i you know flexed too her taking preference and her communication style uh at the end she was you know speechless had no questions and from then on it has been um very easy transition uh not stressful at all she doesn't call me worrying about um my school work or anything because from now on i've realized that any time she has a concern with anything that i'm taking on i simply approach her with a proposal uhclearing all the concerns that she had so uh the outcome is uh definitely a peace of mind and um peace of mind and handling my school work and my internship
last semester i had a group project with my fraternity brother and in which we got along fine but the thing was we had different intentions for our outcome in the class so with that being said when it came time for um deadlines handing in certain assignments um and basically meeting with the group uh there was definitely a gap in communication so one of the things that i began to do was simply um meet with him one on one and also give little reminders uh  and offer help uh whenever he needed um and also one of the things that i did was kind of cater to his uh needs so that we could you know get the job done and get a good grade in the class uh and one of the ways that i did that was ask for his schedule uh opportunities when he could meet up or opportunities when he could do the work so that i was able to meet with him and help him out with the assignment and the way i interacted with him was not necessarily delegating or uh telling him what to do but simply um asking questions and saying what worked for him uh basically flexing to his needs his preference um which wasyou know which worked out very well there was def definitely some bumps and bruises along when he wouldn't hand in the you know hand in or send me material when he said he would uh and the way i would go about that is not simply i wouldn't get mad or take it out on frustrations simply asking with questionsuh kind of like a um um allow him to think about what he's doing for the entire group um simply things like you know 'our grade rests on you?'um if you're you know not gonna get it on time that's gonna you know affect us if you can't do it just simply let us know uh so that we can you know help you out um anyway it is a group effort so um the outcome was uh it worked well we definitely had some bumps and bruises but um the style i learned was simply just from another self help book which was um 'the seven habits of highly effective people' so just simply implementing some of those skills learned there uh definitely helped me out with uh managing different thinking styles and preferences within our group um and the outcome was we got a good grade in the class
last semester at tcnj i worked for a department called mtss media technology supporter systems which we basically took care of all of the uh we trouble shot all the issues in the classrooms whether it be the computers weren't starting up right the projectors were malfunctioning uh anything of that nature anything technology based uh on the entire campus we took care of it and in that there was a lot of tedious boring uh not necessarily physically demanding tasks but uh definitely tedious because at our job site we were able to do work and uh to be hit with a media call at the help desk to go do it was definitely uh something that was um a little aggravating to say the least and uh in that we had one member of our group was more of a senior member but she was as well a college student and whenever there were assigned tasks she always assigned every one of us rarely did she ever go out and do that so one of the best way i just simply did it was um offer to her if she could go do it sometimes when i wasn't able to do it um you know i figured out it never hurts to ask so whenever i figured that i had been doing plenty of jobs during my day i put in my share um because i was able to you know know which task i did what other tasks everybody else did because we had a board with assignments and we would write our names down basically assigned it so i would see who hadn't done any and i would just simply propose that um whoever hasn't done the most work should probably go get the assigned task so i would just simply ask and inquire they would be uh um be able to do which would be our senior management from time to time um and most of the time she had no problem or issue doing it and so that definitely freed up more time and released some stress um and um allowed me to get more work done during my uh during my work hours so um the outcome was that we all were able to um put in the same effort in our job which definitely should be the end goal so there no tension or uh trouble
this scenario definitely falls more into my fraternity organization as a individual member rather than a group project uh when one of the members was uh not the vice president but he was the treasurer of our organization and their current vice president wasn't really uh you know uh he wasn't uh performing to uh definitely the best of his abilities or the role that his job uh demanded in that one of our members that was the treasurer took his position uh which in return um definitely uh interfered with uh several of his philosophies because the guy who was his you know his uh the current vice president was one of his best friends and uh definitely there was some guilt uh some struggle because we had a problem how to uh approach the situation so the best way i handled the situation was uh basically raised awareness that we were doing it for the best interest of our fraternity brother and also the best interest of our entire organization so um if anybody was in a situation that was not bettering themselves or the people that they were um you know the people that they were responsible for than as a neighbor we definitely should have taken action uh which was the right way and not to feel guilty about it but understand that this was for the best interest and we were doing it for uh uh a common good for both our fraternity brother and our entire organization uh which definitely uh went extremely well there was no regrets our brother uh that resigned from the vice president position still comes to all of our um still comes to all of the chapter meetings uh he attends all social events come to all of our uh philanthropy events and so uh in that return there organization runs very smoothly and uh the outcome was um you know fraternity brother that is doing well and our organization is running well
so fall into a uh plenty of scenarios that would happened at my previous job at mtss we need a technician uh support system at the college of new jersey in that i had to uh definitely uh heighten my awareness and listening skills when it came to uh solving problems and solutions within certain classrooms uh and also working with other group members uh there was a lot of technical and procedural message that went into a lot of uh our assignments and so uh with that being said there was definitely a level of confusion so moving forward i definitely had to uh raise the awareness of my listening skills and uh i also utilized the uh importance of technology writing down a lot of things writing down a lot of the thing i heard or sometimes even recording thing just for uh reference when it came to uh taking on the certain tasks and um uh the outcome was that over time it definitely took a little bit of uh time to get used to all of the technical and procedural methods but over time uh through repetition and consecutively going out to these jobs uh i got into the hang of things and uh yeah it worked out well
my two thousand thirteen summer uh job at the faa federal aviation administration ran into um a situation when i was working with several of my group some of who were college students some of who were high school students um and in there one of the members said a uh racial comment which was definitely not suitable for the workplace it didn't necessarily offend me but i uh thought about uh how this could positively or negatively impact other members in the organization not to mentions uh that member had a uh mother who worked in the workplace so i just thought that would not go well um if that information got out so i simply uh contacted my direct report who had um who was in direct contact with uh our boss so i simply approached her about the situation um basically to raise the awareness that there are other member um on the team who have different ethnicity or race um different backgrounds um culture differences and so from then on it went to a meeting with me uh my direct report and also our boss and what i did was in the situation uh told her what happened and additionally um empathized uh with my other coworkers uh who were full time employees there i was just mentioning how this could definitely um play bad and be a bad look on the um it's where i met before uh um on the interns um program and initiative to have interns come in and say any types of things and that it could definitely um have a negative uh um turn so um the solution came about to be i provided the um need to raise the awareness and we ended up having a diversity um uh session which they then implemented for the entire team
uh this summer it was my internship i was teaching a content uh for cox communication group one of which was uh thinking preferences which can be on a very complex a lot of tech uh very complex um information uh different areas of the brain um cerebral cortex limbic uh area all of which our audience was not very familiar with um even if some were some weren't so what we had to do is uh cater the material towards them using uh several terms providing uh visuals so that they can have a better understanding so we understood that some people prefer bullet points some people prefer visual stacks um so we simply um catered to all their needs did activities that were interactive because some people um definitely understand more um content when they're interacting um when they're interacting some people do well when they have the hard you know faster material in front of the face which is something we did as well in addition we also provided them with visual so that they can understand and have a visual presentation of the material and the outcome was uh the initiative was well received they understand all of the content in addition what we did was simply at the end of the um session we would ask questions like simply like you know what questions do you have? so that we can uh basically um have the entire class on a level playing field so they understand all the content um when they were exiting the session and from the feed back from um after many of the uh programs in the session um it was uh lost of positive uh very impactful um and it ended up return and in return our miami location uh took initiative to start a new program um around this diversity and inclusion initiative which had to do with our thinking preference so um a very positive outcome in that whole initiative and the flex
early on in my career before i moved into management i worked as a facilitator uh for continuous improvement problem solving teams my job there was to assist the team leader in getting his team through a problem solving process i would have the expertise as far as problem solving message group dynamics that type of thing and i would then facilitate the group initially influence in the group was very strong until they started to become a more effective unit once they started becoming effective my job became more observational um uh as far as the general behavior of the group was concerned i would look for critical intervention points or things where the group needed uh something to help as far as the dynamics were concerned um in a number of the projects uh the idea was there was some kind of a critical situation that they needed to address to overcome a problem with a client or contract uh what we were able to do is by using good problem solving methodology collecting data and then analyzing that effectively  the teams would have the technical expertise to then carry the solution through to fulfillment uh i did this for about ten years um most of the teams were extremely successful uh achieving their desired results uh the biggest problem that we had the funny part is the biggest problem that we had was once the teams became effective and became good functional unit they didn't want to terminate so then we had to deal with the issues of how do you kill off an effective problem solving team? but in most cases it was very effective the leader would take the responsibility for the group i was then responsible just for the um function of the group while it was working
uh great question uh i am a manager now and i have responsibility for motivating or maintaining a spirit of uh excitement in my work force um i'll tell you a little story that um happened early on in my background when i was learning continuous improvement i had mentors who were specialists in groups dynamics and that type of thing and one of them uh peter shoulders was a specialist who had a presentation on group dynamics and specifically this one was uh addressing motivation and so the seminar started out with us going back and forth and he said we'd like you to uh work together at your table and think about the worst job you ever had what were the types of things that came up with that? and generally what happened is people commented about busy work uh not having to think about things uh being belittled uh not being respected not given a challenge not having excitement  and so when people talked about the worst jobs they've ever had these were common traits and when they were asked to then talk about the most exciting jobs they've ever had uh the ideas came up with whatever i was working on was important i had the trust of my uh supervisor it was an exciting challenge he dared me to think so the idea in motivation is more so in trying to bring that level of excitement that level of interest uh trust importance and helping people to grow and become more effective at what they do so motivation isn't so much something that you do financially as much as it is presenting an operational situation where people believe they have an opportunity to succeed through doing important work and uh that it's not just the busy work to getting the use their head and they're valued as a person
this is an interesting question uh there are situations where i've been either a member of a group or i've been a supervisor of personnel who didn't get along i'll tell you briefly about the one where i was a supervisor personnel and i had two people that were constantly going back and forth initially uh i had gone through some training activities where people said uh we need to talk about uh communicating methods when do you do this i feel because i wish you would and that type of thing and run those exercises i tried that and i found that one of the people in that uh competitive situation actually worked that to their advantage to try and make things worse uh so that exercise although was well meaning uh actually failed miserably so uh funny part is the bickering continued so uh what i actually did was uh i used uh a mutual destructive type of an approach i just simply explained to them that the bickering and the battling couldn't go on anymore and quite frankly i didn't care who started it or who was responsible for it  if it continues i was going to relieve them both of their positions and actually that stopped the problem in teams that i've been uh a member and worked where we've had situations where people didn't particularly get along i would try and keep us focused on whatever the objective was in the team uh i would work on uh staying focused on using the tools that were explained to use to use i would try and keep this focused on individual steps and missions and take opportunities uh where the two would become uh competitive out of that activity and try and develop an area where we'd stay focused on the mission
it's uh another interesting question and very appropriate for my current responsibilities uh as an executive director of quality i have to try and influence with different working groups to adopt uh best methods and techniques uh to improve their operation and performance uh of course in most cases where an outside uh source of information were not necessarily part of the group so the trust issue plays a large factor in the uh process uh we have to take the time to uh explain what we would like to accomplish why we believe this would benefit them what uh would be involved with the activities uh we try and reinforce the uh sense of leadership responsibilities in their organization that uh try and reinforce the idea that the control is still with them while at the same time you're trying to move ahead on uh a mission uh  sometimes it works really well sometimes it doesn't work very well uh but the idea is you still have to accomplish the objectives and you constantly have to rethink the situation look for opportunities where you might be putting yourself at risk or damaging that trust relationship with the leaders uh sometimes you have to reach out and uh ask them what's going on uh we seem to be having difficulties with this what can we do to get past this? uh i don't know that there's ever a petty answer on how this can be approached but uh in most cases i've been very successful usually it works much better when there's a sense of urgency then you can take advantage of that situation where there's not as greater sense of urgency it's not as easy an opportunity to work
i mean my line of work uh quality and continuous improvement uh negotiating compromising is uh pretty much a fact of life uh our job is to help people see what is going on understand the nature of the problem try and develop solutions and move forward on that a lot of the times uh they may perceive it as a risk uh a threat to their security uh a threat to a position and their incomes so we have to be sensitive to that as we're working through this type of activity um what i usually try and do is recognize the common goal and address that understand what their concerns are present opportunities where we might be able to approach it from a certain way or just recognize that um our work to uh keep them safe through the process that we'll do what's only required that we've agreed to do um reinforce with them that uh they have some control in the way this is going to come out and try and make sure that they understand that they have a much greater participatory role in the activity than they would initially think and that people although they were asking for corrective actions weren't asking for something that was particularly unfair or unwarranted so once we get that sense of agreement we try and work forward on that and usually we've been very successful
again in my responsibilities in quality and continuous improvement trying to persuade uh people to uh move in a certain direction is a way of life in my operation it's been one of my responsibilities whether as a facilitator or whether as a manager or even today as a director uh usually what we try and do is figure out uh what the situation is uh how we might best to identify some opportunities uh uh developing value or interest with the organization uh we try and outline simply what would be involved in the proposal uh we would try and explain the long-term benefits of this activity we would try and identify some of the needs for why we move forward on this uh if we have data it's worth it's weight in gold if you can put it on a chart it's even more valuable uh tables of numbers aren't as usually understood as charts and graphs are  charts and graphs do a tremendous job of transmitting a lot of the information in a very short period of time uh so if you want to expose situations or ideas charts and graphs are very effective in helping to make this happen uh i've had a variety of uh results from overwhelming successes where people just caught onto it immediately and carried out on the uh proposal and i've had situations where uh we've proposed this grand scheme and activity and uh as it turns out we've had to take it piecemeal a little bit at a time get a concession of willingness to try something going forward uh and then hopefully you stay focused you stay disciplined you remember the long-term objectives and keep pursuing that
it's a challenging and interesting question um from time to time you always run into somebody that you don't particularly uh care for or you won't necessarily get along with um i usually find that um i'm very easy to work with i usually like working with most people uh sometimes there's no accounting for the interactions of other persons they may have a separate agenda they may have different objectives what i try to do is i try and stay focused on what we're trying to accomplish in the long run again i try and focus on commonality of effort uh commonality of objectives and goals um i try not to get emotionally involved in the activities uh you uh stay focused on what you're trying to accomplish uh you don't necessarily have to be liked to uh move forward on what you're trying to accomplish so i try and stay focused on what it is i try and stay pleasant uh i use normal um greetings how are you doing? hello uh say good morning to when you see them uh i try and stay out of a personal type of conversations and things that i guess that's a bit defensive but uh personal issues aren't necessarily important to uh accomplish in what you're trying to work with in the long run with that person so i just try and keep it professional stay focused on what we're trying to do and uh stay polite and uh just working on it a little bit at a time
uh it's funny uh there's not very many things that i've come into uh contact with that were particularly unpleasant or demanding uh tasks you know sometimes things that are repetitive or uh could be boring and uh sometimes they are tough to accomplish but uh i've always tried to approach things from the idea of whatever i'm working on i try to do to the best of my ability i try and stay positive when i'm working on it uh you have times when you can talk to your supervisors about what's going on uh usually i take pride in doing whatever i'm working on well and as well as i possibly can if there's a running joke'if they ask you to make copies you be the best copy maker in the business' and uh try and improve your uh reputation by being the best at whatever it is they're asking you to do uh sometimes uh you understand that a lot of times extra things will be uh given to you because you may be the most capable person doing that work and sometimes the supervisor will uh dump a little bit more on your plate because they believe you're capable of doing it and that they need to succeed in the long run so you can always talk to your supervisor about the distribution of work but my uh basic approach is do it as well as you possibly can and be the best at it uh that you can while you actually do what you're doing
um this hasn't happened very often to start with um i have been exposed to one or two situations where there's been new leadership that's come in to an organization um and they um appear to have been going off in a different direction that what the uh original process might have indicated and i have seen situations where uh they seem to express a certain opinion or direction that they choose to pursue and have ignored uh information or ideas that didn't necessarily agree with their decision um you try and understand where they are coming from uh you ask questions you try and learn what going on what's the motivation maybe they have information that you're not aware of um so first of all you seek to understand uh the situation understand their thinking what are they up against? um and then if there's uh information that you think would be beneficial to uh present to them i always try and present it in a database solutions with uh and i said before charts or graphs charts or graphs are tremendous in taking the uh personality of the argument out of it uh there's something that's remarkably freeing about charts and graphs where people see information and they go i had no idea or that's something i hadn't thought about or how long has this been going on? they a lot of times what you'll see is um a surprise when you're working on data and again it takes a lot of the personality out of the argument and the discussions
listening skills uh this is pretty good uh this is also a learning activity that i went through very early on in my career i used to be uh  when i was much much younger uh very cocky and arrogant and confident and believed that i had the only right answers and that uh i just couldn't understand why people didn't see the brilliance of whatever i was thinking about um and then uh i was fortunate enough to go through a lot of training where uh we were learning to be facilitators of groups where listening skills were a core element in the training activities and the uh training that went back and forth was on understanding the nature of communications that um if you're thinking about a response or you're thinking about a way to come back at some kind of comment that someone's making first of all you're not listening and hearing what they are saying uh so it's important to listen to what the conversation is going on  uh also part of good listening is being able to ask questions to learn more and understand better uh the situation that you're dealing with um we only have a certain limited amount of exposure to situations uh held on a personal basis so uh the more questions we seek to understand the situation the more effective we can be also when you're practicing listening and asking for input and asking for information you're drawing that person into a common relationship and building their sense of importance in the conversation um and you in fact do uh improve their uh position in the relationship so it makes you in a much more effective um activity to go forward with
uh it's an interesting this whole interview could have been focused on my job responsibilities in quality we always have opportunities where uh we're going to have to communicates some difficult information or we may have some critical feedback that needs to be uh managed up if you will uh usually what i try and do if i have to do that is recognize that first of all uh it's important to my supervisor or manager to uh have the information that i might uh have so they're protected and knowledgeable and they are able to deal with it if they're asked about it that uh there's nothing worse than getting caught with your pants down so you have to realize that some of this information and some of this feedback may be very helpful to them in the long run and that we have a responsibility to provide that information usually what i'll try and do is uh explain that uh we have an issue we talk about it uh i'll explain the background in the situation what the uh negative information or the difficult feedback is and then ask them how that they want to deal with it  is is there anything i can do to support them in carrying on in addressing the situation? but uh i believe uh providing difficult information or critical feedback is absolutely necessary uh again you don't want your boss to be caught unaware in another meeting where someone else might challenge them on this exact information that you have you can't just hide it if you fail uh at something that's also true you know sometimes you just blow it and you have to let them know that that situation came about you can't hide it you can't get away with it
um statistical process control is sometimes considered a very complex or technical type of an issues and a lot of times the people that you are dealing with although they work in processes aren't necessarily aware of how statistical process control would work uh and the fact of the matter is they don't necessarily need to know how it works the idea is you need to be able to take uh complex ideas down to a nontechnical uh level you can talk about um a normal distribution but you can talk about it in a bell curve you don't have to talk about modes of uh distribution you can say the top of the hill uh standard deviation you can talk about the formula but the reality is is they just need to know uh a normal curve is defined by standard deviation since standard deviation is just a standard measure that we are able to talk about and apply across uh different uh mediums but to do that it's a lot easier to do it with graphs and charts uh simple things that aren't too challenging again you try and relate it to the activities that we're talking about put it in common terms that they're familiar with um and explain how it relates to their activity um a process performance is actually a behavior so if you can talk about the way that the processes is behaving over time they don't need to know that there's a lot of variation going on and there's special causes of variation you can talking about an unusual event and understand that once the unusual event was gone well i'm running out of time so
